In a petition in the Court, a couple facing secondary infertility sought to use surrogacy, as under the Surrogacy Act, surrogacy cannot be resorted to for the second child. Their advocate argued that the state cannot interfere in the private lives and reproductive choices of citizens. Secondary infertility is when a couple is unable to conceive, or carry a pregnancy to term, though they have previously birthed children naturally. The causes are similar to primary infertility \u2014 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, endometriosis, and lifestyle factors. The petitioners sought an exemption to have a second child through surrogacy, submitting that the definition of \u2018infertility\u2019 in the context of surrogacy, both in the ART and the Surrogacy Acts, was not restricted to only primary infertility. Under Section 4(iii)(C)(II) of India\u2019s Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, a couple is eligible for surrogacy only if they do not have any surviving child (biological, adopted, or through surrogacy). Exceptions are made only if the existing child is mentally or physically challenged or has a life-threatening disorder. The government submitted arguments supporting the view that surrogacy cannot be deemed a fundamental right, and that it involves the use of another woman\u2019s body. While the judge orally remarked that the restriction imposed under the provision was \u201creasonable\u201d, the Court has decided to examine whether a law banning married couples facing secondary infertility from using surrogacy to have a second child amounts to a restriction on the reproductive choices of citizens.It may be noted that the Court recently diluted the age specification for surrogacy, allowing age relaxation for couples who had frozen embryos prior to passing the Act. If the avowed intent of the law, as argued at the stage of debate, is to prevent commercial surrogacy, or exploitative situations taking advantage of vulnerable women, besides regulating the mushrooming fertility centres (in conjunction with the ART Act), then to impose restrictions differentiating between primary and secondary fertility seems like splitting hairs. Currently, there is no law restricting the number of children a person can have in India, though many States have incentivised a two-child norm in terms of government benefits, jobs or political offices. A more expansive interpretation of the law, facilitating, for all those in need, access to the benefits of technology, is likely to satisfy two requirements \u2014 assisting intending parents, and preventing commercial surrogacy.

        "full_article": "By showing that food alone drives five of the six breached planetary boundaries and about 30% of greenhouse-gas emissions worldwide, the new \u2018EAT-Lancet Commission on healthy, sustainable, and just food systems\u2019 report shows how food systems are at the centre of the overlapping climate, biodiversity, water, and pollution crises. Foods from animals account for most agricultural emissions whereas the grains dominate nitrogen, phosphorus, and water use. Only combined action, including cuts to food loss, enhanced and durable productivity gains, and dietary changes, can reverse these trends. The prediction on biogeochemical flows is stark: current agriculture leaves a global nitrogen surplus more than twice in excess of the safe limit. Efficiency gains left uncorrected by good policy can also spur more output that then erases environmental savings. The Commission is pragmatic, too, acknowledging that a response combining everything from dietary changes to emissions mitigation would still only barely return the world\u2019s food systems to safety vis-\u00e0-vis the climate and freshwater crises by mid-century; the pressure on nutrient security will remain. It does make one questionable assumption, that GDP will grow 127% in 30 years, whereas policy should focus on lower growth and worse climate shocks.According to the report, India maintains a cereal-heavy diet while meeting benchmarks by 2050 entails more vegetables, fruits, nuts and legumes, which could raise average consumer prices. Affordability is already fragile in areas that import many of these foods, leaving consumers exposed to price shocks. Justice thus implies a transition towards healthier, more diverse diets while keeping prices in check. But changing diets may not always be desirable: preferences are anchored in religion, caste, and convenience, and on necessity vis-\u00e0-vis midday meals and procurement commitments. Rather than a diet-first strategy, then, new standards can cut harmful inputs, fiscal measures can make minimally processed foods cheaper, and procurement can normalise regionally familiar, more affordable dishes. Even then, supply-side reform is essential to overcome water stress, degraded soils, and fossil fuel dependence in cold chains and processing. India also needs to move away from implicit, open-ended incentives to extract groundwater. Finally, the Commission identifies market concentration, weak incentives for preventing labour and ecological harm, and undue corporate influence as factors that could stall change. Justice on the other hand demands stronger collective bargaining by workers and small producers and consumer representation in regulatory processes. These safeguards are partial at best today and need to become guaranteed in practice.

        "full_article": "Politics turns sharply right or left when centrists ignore the social contract of tech-led entrepreneurship model\nThe NYC mayoral result shouldn\u2019t be seen through the lens of a Trump vs Mamdani bout. Yes, a young, foreign-born, Muslim democratic socialist will now lead the capital of capitalism, defying opposition from Trump and other billionaires.\nBut is it because of who he is, or what he publicly stands for? Mamdani the man, or the idea of Mamdani in the context of a moment in history? Clearly the latter.\nJust as America, overall, veered sharply right last year to find solutions to its problems, NYC has now swung left. And both outcomes reflect the growing disenchantment with the centre.\nWhich is unfortunate because centrism \u2013 founded on the principles of individual rights, equal opportunity, liberal democracy and cultural pluralism \u2013 has shaped the world since WWII. And while it has flaws in practice, it has generally served well.\nTrade, migration, economic growth, cultural mingling, all advance when the mood isn\u2019t polarised, when communities and countries aren\u2019t constantly bad-mouthed and painted as the cause of our troubles. In theory, centrism is meant to carry people along to a better place. That\u2019s its social contract.\nBut the US vote on Nov 5 last year, and NYC\u2019s vote on Nov 4 this year, show the people consider this contract broken. That\u2019s because they find themselves worse off than they were before. There\u2019s the cost of living crisis \u2013 a quarter of New Yorkers can\u2019t afford food and rent.\nThe city\u2019s poverty rate was double the national average in 2023, and grew by 7 percentage points in the next two years. Meanwhile, the rich keep getting richer.\nThe number of billionaires goes on rising. When voters get the feeling the system isn\u2019t working for them, they choose the \u2018outsider\u2019 promising free childcare, free buses and rent control \u2013 all very un-American things.\nBut the mood that\u2019s gripped American voters is also palpable in other democracies. The space for polarisation and populism has been growing in Europe and India.\nEverywhere, the complaint is the same \u2013 people\u2019s simple needs aren\u2019t being met. The housing market, especially, is broken everywhere, including India.\nSo, xenophobia and promises of state action can be seductive.\nThat\u2019s bad news for not only centrists but also the technology-led entrepreneurship model they have enabled, which has brought about record growth over the past few decades.\nCentrist leaders must introspect and course-correct before the pendulum swings too far to the right or the left.\n\n",

But India isn\u2019t consistently sticking to its syncretism\nIn a despicable but not wholly unexpected move, Pakistani authorities separated and barred Hindu pilgrims from travelling to Nankana Sahib for the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev, while allowing Sikh pilgrims through.\nThis was the first Sikh jatha (religious group) to travel to Nankana Sahib after Operation Sindoor. Hindu pilgrims were also part of the group. In barring the latter, Pakistan has further exposed its moral bankruptcy.\nIt\u2019s a failed basket case of a state that can\u2019t stomach the fact it will never be able to catch up with India.\nHence, it resorts to petty tactics. Plus, Pakistan\u2019s deep state has been trying to sow divisions between India\u2019s Sikhs and Hindus by working with known khalistanis abroad. It won\u2019t succeed.\nThat said, there\u2019s also a recent trend in India to replicate Pakistan\u2019s pettiness. But this tit-for-tat approach not only ill behoves our secular, syncretic traditions but also gives joy to Islamabad. Pakistan\u2019s very existence is premised on the idea that a secular India can\u2019t survive.\nWe have proved them wrong for 78 years. When Op Sindoor was launched, dealing Pakistan a bloody nose, it was Colonel Sofiya Qureshi and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh \u2013 a Muslim and a Hindu \u2013 who together conducted the media briefings.\nIt is this secular India that is the biggest challenge for Pakistan.\nBut this secular strength needs to be nurtured and protected on a daily basis. Traditions like Delhi\u2019s Phool Walon Ki Sair that bring Hindus and Muslims together are an integral part of our syncretic ethos.\nIt\u2019s terrible that Phool Walon Ki Sair won\u2019t be held this year for the first time in more than six decades \u2013 thanks to administrative permissions not coming through.\nSuch secular cultural heritage needs to be prioritised.

For that to happen, all political actors and the government must make a genuine commitment to curbing the violence that too often taints the nation's political landscape.\nThe brazen assault occurred while BNP's nominated candidate for the Chattogram-8 constituency, Ershad Ullah, and his supporters were distributing leaflets in the port city's Purbo Bayezid area. According to initial reports, seven to eight armed assailants arrived in a microbus, opened fire, and fled the scene. Police were quick to assert that the BNP leader was not the target but was struck by a stray bullet. They concluded that the actual target was the deceased, Sarwar Babla, a man with an extensive criminal record. The official version described the attack as the outcome of an ongoing gang feud rather than political violence.\nBut that is hardly any comfort. The fact that a known criminal was present at a voter outreach event is itself alarming. Reports confirm that Sarwar had been in and out of jail on charges including possession of an AK-47 rifle. Once an associate of a notorious crime boss, he later formed his own gang, waging turf wars over extortion and other illicit activities. This was not his first brush with violence, of course. Just months earlier, Sarwar narrowly escaped an ambush that killed two of his companions. The latest episode, playing out in the shadow of a political campaign, illustrates a terrifying blurring of lines between crimes and politics.\nThe Chief Adviser's Office has condemned the attack, promising a swift investigation and reaffirming that \"violence and intimidation have no place in our political or social life.\" Yet history shows a darker trend: political parties across the spectrum have too often relied on unsavoury figures to supply muscle and mobilise voters. Such alliances erode public trust and undermine the integrity of elections. That practice must end.\nNow, a credible investigation must go beyond apprehending the gunmen to examine why a man facing multiple criminal cases was present at a political event. Also, it is time to confront the nexus between local politicians and criminal syndicates that allows such figures to thrive. With the election fast approaching, the responsibility lies with all parties to renounce violent enforcers. For their part, law enforcement agencies must act as neutral guardians of peace.\n",

Yet, welcome as the initiative is, the challenges it presents call for a far more coordinated and sustained approach than what sporadic drives or blocking of accounts alone can achieve.\nThe meeting-attended by representatives from BTRC, law enforcement agencies, financial regulators, mobile operators, and mobile financial service (MFS) providers-highlighted the alarming spread of online gambling across all sections of society. What began as a fringe indulgence has now grown into a tech-driven addiction, causing financial ruin and emotional distress to countless individuals and families. Reports suggest that the authorities have already closed around 5,000 MFS accounts linked to gambling transactions. Blocking identified accounts is certainly a good starting point, but it cannot be the endgame. The digital nature of these platforms allows them to re-emerge swiftly under new domains or identities. Hence, the government's plan to create a shared database-allowing cross-agency data exchange and surveillance-is a prudent step towards building a more comprehensive monitoring framework. Equally important is the proposed guideline for media outlets on configuring web browsers and AdSense to restrict gambling-related content, now under review at the Information Ministry. A separate digital advertising policy, once approved, could help reduce the promotional reach of these illicit platforms.\nOnline gambling is not merely a legal or financial issue-it is a profound social and psychological threat. Medical professionals warn that it can lead to compulsive behaviour akin to substance addiction. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) recognises gambling addiction as a psychiatric disorder when it becomes pathological. The constant availability, anonymity, and instant gratification offered by smartphones and computers amplify the risks compared to traditional gambling. For many, this addiction leads to spiralling debts, broken families and even mental breakdowns. Moreover, the moral dimension cannot be ignored. Gambling corrodes the ethic of honest labour and thrift, peddling the illusion of easy wealth without effort. Its aggressive online advertising and gamified interfaces are particularly dangerous for the youth, who are lured into a cycle of risk-taking and instant reward before they are emotionally or financially mature enough to handle the consequences.\nThe government's move to curb this growing vice must therefore translate into an enduring, multi-agency strategy-combining technological vigilance, financial regulation, legal enforcement and public awareness. The battle against online gambling is not just about policing digital platforms; it is about protecting families, preserving social stability and reaffirming a moral order. Now that the authorities have finally taken a firm stand, one can only hope that this resolve will endure and evolve into a robust, coordinated mechanism capable of reining in the peril once and for all.\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Involved with the ground-breaking research was Miles Richardson, a famed professor of Nature connectedness at the University of Derby. The study published in the journal Ambio interviewed 57,000 people in 61 countries to examine how human attitude towards Nature is shaped by social, cultural, religious, economic and geographic factors. As a first try, this study on 61 countries may not precisely make a list of nations with closer affinity for the natural world. Because it has surveyed fewer than one-third of the total number of the planet's nations estimated at 195--- with 193 full members of the United Nations (UN) and two non-member observer states: the Holy Vatican City and the State of Palestine. \nNepal tops the list followed by Iran, South Africa, Bangladesh and Nigeria. Croatia and Bulgaria were the only two European nations to have a berth in the top 10 nations. Chile, Ghana and Tunisia are the other members of the top-10 club. Then what are the criteria for developing a close relationship with Nature? According to the study, spirituality and religious faith are the determinants of forging a tie to the natural world. The deeper the spirituality and faith in religion are, the closer the attachment with natural environment. Spirituality is the forte of the Nepalese. On the other hand, negative correlation is embedded in the World Bank's \"ease of doing business\" metric. Countries boasting more market-friendly and business-oriented economies have accounted for poorer emotional ties to the ecosystem all around. \nThe research team led by Prof. Richardson has developed the Nature-connection index, as claimed by it, \"through comprehensive surveys measuring emotional attachment and psychological affiliation\" with the natural environment sustaining life. On that count, industrially advanced nations have generally found themselves wanting in their effort to get closer to Nature. What is particularly remarkable in this context is that stunning natural sceneries are no guarantee for a nation to fall in love with those. Japan is home to some of the exquisitely panoramic views and the land of Pablo Picasso and Federico Garcia Lorca, Spain that is, also boasts quite a number of gorgeous Mediterranean views. \nSo the ranking of Spain and Japan as the least Nature-connected nations gives some food for thought. Spain known for a midday siesta is not as much industrialised and mechanised as some of the European countries like Britain and Germany. Yet it holds the last slot in the list and Japan follows to place it at the last but one spot. Israel and Saudi Arabia cannot be blamed for maintaining some distance from natural environment. But the land of Beethoven and Mozart should not have earned a slot in the last decile. Similarly, the nation that painstakingly developed the iconic botanical garden called Kew in London has also found itself lumbering at the 7th place from the bottom. Contrary to popular expectation, the Netherlands, famous for tulips, also hobbles to have a place just behind the UK. \nGiven such anachronisms, the attainment of Bangladesh is still a pleasant surprise. How can a nation that is widely known for declaring rivers of the country as living entities but in effect killing those by strangulation and maltreating other water bodies at the risk of harming the biodiversity of the country earn the 4th place in the index of the Nature-connectedness? Plundering sand, stones including white stones from Bholaganj, Sylhet, earth from hills, trees from reserved forests and poaching in the Sunderbans go unabated. There are few nations in the world which are so inimical to natural resources. Yet, strangely, the nation has been one of the top five to solemnly express its love for Nature. \nBut how does Bangladesh become a frontrunner in demonstrating its passion and emotion of the natural bond? The answer lies in the instinct of common people like Sirajul Islam Howladar from Patuakhali, Badshah Mian from Peerganj, Rangpur, Abdul Samad Sheikh from Jashore, Shah Sikandar Ahmad Sakir from Sylhet, Abdul Kadir, Gabura Union, Satkhira, Md Abdul Wahid Sardar from Jashore, Sirajul Islam from Galachipa, Patuakhali. All these people have developed a passion for tree plantation without any guidance and instruction. They are passionate about tree plantation and inspiring others to follow in their footsteps so that the land turns more and more green. \nThe looters of natural resources may outnumber such individuals who have made plantation of trees a lifelong mission but the latter have made the message clear: without trees, herbs and shrubs, human life will not survive on this planet. What these people feel instinctively, the educated and the privileged miss because of their overriding concern for making money by means fair or foul. Naturalists and environmentalists have in-depth knowledge of plants, animals and living organisms of all forms along with the environment in which their lives prosper. Men like Dwijen Sharma and Salim Ali, a world famous ornithologist, have shown by example that love for Nature is love for the human race. One need not be a naturalist and primatologist like Dian Fossey to save exotic species. Yet one can still contribute to preserving the biological ecosystem for the posterity. \nBangladesh could be a far better place to live in if only the avarice of the influential people could be restrained. They feel no qualm about money laundering, exhausting natural resources for unlimited personal gains at the expense of environmental and ecological resilience of the land. They are the people who are responsible for exacerbating the discriminatory impacts on the land and its people. Notwithstanding the plunderers' negative correlation with natural environment, the common people's sense of oneness with Nature has triumphed as highlighted by the Richardson-led research team's study.\n \nnilratanhalder2000@yahoo.com\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Besides serving as an ingenious way to diversify rural economies in many countries across regions, it is preserving local culture and heritage. As a nation with rich natural and cultural resources scattered countrywide, Bangladesh holds huge potential for turning them into tourism hotspots. Rural areas boast numerous tourism appeals --- lush vegetation, unique inland waterways, diverse cultural heritage and tribal communities. But they remain neglected. While tourists - local and international --- flood certain destinations like Cox's Bazar, lesser-known rural tourism attractions receive little attention. Several factors hold back the country from tapping the rural tourism potential --- a lack of vision and comprehensive planning, weak transport infrastructure in rural areas, insufficient promotion of rural tourism sites and issues of safety and security.\nBangladesh should no longer lag behind in exploiting its rural tourism potential. The time is ripe for the country to catch up and the lessons from other countries offer clear guidance for adoption. For example, according to a study report available on ResearchGate, rural tourism's income in China in the first quarter of 2024 accounted for 5.1 per cent of GDP in rural regions. In Sri Lanka, tourism, a major part of which is rural tourism, contributed 4.9 per cent of national GDP in recent years. When rural areas become tourism destinations, the economic ripple effects, such as job creation, craft production, homestays and local food businesses improve and infrastructure gets upgraded.\nAmong the obstacles to Bangladesh tapping its rural tourism potential, the main one is the absence of a comprehensive plan for rural tourism. Though the ministry of tourism has identified spot lists of potential rural tourism sites in various districts, these remain fragmented and lack follow-through. Unlike in China, where rural tourism is embedded into regional development strategies, in Bangladesh it often remains a marginal afterthought.\nTransport infrastructure is a particular weakness in the promotion of village tourism. Many villages lack paved roads, reliable public transport or safe access after daylight. For tourism promotion, accessibility, comfort and safety for guests are not optional things; they are a must. A village may be beautiful but not worth visiting without roads, comfortable guest accommodation, electricity and internet connectivity, safe food, and basic safety arrangements. We must recognise that rural tourism cannot flourish unless these enabling conditions are met.\nBangladesh does not need to invent anything to tap its rural tourism potential. Just replicating the approach that China and Sri Lanka are following will be enough to kickstart the process. The country will require to offer incentives and create rural tourism clusters that attract private investment in homestays and cultural events. Safety and hospitality standards have to be improved. Accredited training for guest-house hosts will be of great help in this regard.\nConsistent promotion of village tourism will also be necessary. Bangladesh's tourism branding is largely focused on beaches and cities. Rural tourism requires a different narrative. It should highlight the authenticity, cultural encounters, nature and off-beat experiences that village tourism may offer.\nImagine how a tourist will feel when he or she will reach a village in southern Barishal on a luxurious launch, stay in a comfortable house, join a guava-orchard harvest, take a boat ride and visit a boat haat, enjoy a traditional meal cooked by the host family, buy local souvenirs, and return safely. Each step of the experience - transport, accommodation, activity, food, local product - would generate income for the local community, thus contributing to rural economic development.\nrahmansrdk@gmail.com\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

With just one click, friendship, education, and entertainment are all within reach. Yet behind this convenience, an invisible darkness-cyberbullying-is growing. On social media, mocking someone's clothing, pronunciation, opinion, or body shape has become a source of amusement. What once might have been too shameful to say face-to-face is now a casual comment online.\nWe often forget how this so-called \"normality\" destroys the lives of countless young men and women. Some smile while crying inside, while others quietly disappear. Cyberbullying is not a joke-it is a form of psychological abuse. It undermines confidence, disrupts mental balance and can even drive individuals to take their own lives. In Bangladesh, women are among the most frequent victims of such violence on social media.\nThe solution cannot come overnight. It must begin with education within families. At the same time, strict law enforcement and stronger reporting systems on social media platforms are essential. Above all, we need to restore humanity in the digital world. If we can recognise that even a single word can pierce someone's heart like a knife, perhaps the online world will become a little gentler and safer.\nNusrat Jahan\nStudent \nJagannath University\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
