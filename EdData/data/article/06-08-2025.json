        "full_article": "After months of considerable forbearance, the statement by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), on Monday (August 4, 2025), pushing back against the U.S. and the European Union (EU) for \u201ctargeting\u201d India is significant. The statement came two hours after Mr. Trump had announced penalty tariffs against India, \u201csubstantially\u201d above the current 25% rate set to go into place this week, for importing, processing and selling Russian oil. A day earlier, a senior Trump aide had accused India of \u201cfinancing\u201d Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. And on July 18, 2025, the EU had announced sanctions on India\u2019s Vadinar refinery (partially Russian owned), and secondary sanctions that will affect Indian refiners. The MEA spokesperson said that the measures were \u201cunjustified and unreasonable\u201d as the U.S. and the EU continue to trade with Russia for goods including LNG, critical minerals and nuclear fuel requirements. The statement also said that it was the U.S. that had encouraged India to keep buying Russian oil to stabilise global markets, something the Biden administration had confirmed. The government said that in comparison to the western countries, India\u2019s Russian oil purchases are a \u201cvital national compulsion\u201d as a result of the conflict in Ukraine, adding that India would \u201c... safeguard its national interests and economic security\u201d. The MEA\u2019s statement is the first such clear response on the issue since the Ukraine conflict. Taken with Union Minister Piyush Goyal\u2019s statement last week on the U.S. announcement of 25% reciprocal tariffs on India from August 7, Monday\u2019s statement indicates New Delhi\u2019s growing frustration with the U.S.\u2019s increasingly offensive positions against India, including on immigration, trade negotiations, Operation Sindoor and Pakistan, and India\u2019s BRICS membership. It is unclear how and to what extent the government is prepared to stand up to the bullying tactics of Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump said on Tuesday that India has not been a \u201cgood trading partner\u201d \u2014 a possible reference to trade talks and the failure of a mini-deal, ostensibly over India\u2019s resistance on agricultural market access, dairy products and GM foods.While it is hoped that New Delhi will continue to engage Washington and Brussels to conclude their respective trade talks, the MEA statement is meant to make a larger point. Neither the U.S. nor the EU can decide which country India will partner or trade with. That message is being underlined in visits by Security Adviser Ajit Doval and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar to Moscow, to prepare for the Russian President\u2019s visit to India later this year. India\u2019s sovereignty is non-negotiable and its foreign policy choices cannot be manipulated by other countries, no matter how significant their own ties with India are.\r Published - August 06, 2025 12:20 am IST\n                          Read  Comments \n                Copy link  \n                        \n            \n                    Email     \n                                \n                \n                Facebook   \n                        \n            \n                Twitter    \n                        \n            \n                Telegram     \n                        \n            \n                LinkedIn     \n                        \n            \n                WhatsApp\n                \n                        \n            \n                Reddit      \n                        \n            READ LATER\n                    Remove     \n                \n                SEE ALL         \n                PRINT\n            Related Topics\n        \n                        USA\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        European Union\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        India\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        diplomacy\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        economic sanction\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        oil and gas - upstream activities\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        critical minerals\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        nuclear power\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Russia-Ukraine Crisis\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        trade policy\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        agriculture\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        dairy\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        immigration",

        "full_article": "President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement that he has ordered \u201ctwo nuclear submarines to be positioned in appropriate regions\u201d, in response to the \u201cprovocative statements\u201d by former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, marks a dangerous turn in the U.S.-Russia relationship which the Republican leader had pledged to repair in the run-up to his election late last year. Mr. Medvedev, now the Deputy Chairman of Russia\u2019s Security Council, had said that Mr. Trump\u2019s threats of imposing tariffs on Russia were \u201ca step towards war\u201d. Mr. Trump did not specify whether he has moved submarines capable of launching intercontinental ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads, or nuclear-powered boats equipped with conventional weapons. In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has expressed growing frustration with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin over the Ukraine war. Initially, he gave Mr. Putin a 50-day deadline to end the war or face American tariffs. On July 29, this was shortened to 10 to 12 days. Mr. Trump has also threatened secondary \u201cpenalty\u201d tariffs on countries that trade with Russia such as India and China.Mr. Trump\u2019s frustration is understandable. He pressured Ukraine into accepting a ceasefire proposal. His Defence Secretary publicly stated that Ukraine would not be taken into NATO. Yet, the most that he managed to extract from Mr. Putin was a limited truce in the Black Sea and a temporary pause in attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure. At the heart of the impasse are the divergent views in western capitals and Moscow on how to end the war. While western leaders insist on an immediate ceasefire, Moscow believes that this should be part of a comprehensive peace agreement addressing its core security concerns, including NATO\u2019s eastward expansion. Russia also finds little incentive to de-escalate at a time when its troops have strategic momentum. Ukraine has carried out deadly drone attacks on several Russian cities, but on the battlefield, is struggling to hold the line. Besides, Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to bomb Iran on behalf of Israel, at a time when Tehran was technically in talks with the U.S., appears to have hardened Russia\u2019s position. Nevertheless, diplomatic setbacks are not an excuse for nuclear sabre-rattling. The last thing the world wants today is a direct conflict between the U.S. and Russia. Instead of escalating the crisis, Mr. Trump must reflect on why America\u2019s current approach \u2014 combining sanctions against Russia with military support for Ukraine \u2014 has failed to deter Mr. Putin. His initial turn towards diplomacy was a step in the right direction. He must stay the course and narrow the gap between the western and Russian positions on ending the war.

        "full_article": "Washington is no slouch when it comes to buying from Moscow. So what\u2019s India doing wrong\u00a0\nWhen Russia annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region in 2014, US punished it with sanctions. US-Russia trade, which was worth over $38bn in 2013, slipped to under $35bn in 2014, $23bn in 2015, less than $20bn in 2016, and then started rising again from 2017, although Crimea remained with Russia. What changed was that Obama left White House and Trump came in. In 2021, the last year before Putin invaded Ukraine wholesale, Russian exports to US amounted to $29.6bn \u2013 almost the same as in 2012. This recap is important when Trump is threatening to make an example of India with \u201csubstantially\u201d higher tariffs for buying Russian oil. The same Trump who, in Feb, said Ukraine \u201cshould have never started\u201d the war.\u00a0\nLook at Europe, too. EU\u2019s own data shows it supplied 10.3% of Russian imports last year, and bought 7.3% of its exports. Total goods trade between the \u201cvirtuous\u201d and the sanctioned amounted to a not insignificant $78bn \u2013 much more than the $69bn India-Russia bilateral trade last year. And data from the nonprofit CREA shows EU\u2019s spending on Russian energy last year \u2013 $25.3bn \u2013 was more than its financial assistance to Ukraine \u2013 $21.6bn. That\u2019s why the West\u2019s moral grandstanding on the Ukraine war fails to convince. For Trump officials to accuse India of financing Putin\u2019s war, while ignoring EU\u2019s Russia trade, and America\u2019s own $3bn worth of Russian imports, is nothing but hypocrisy.\nHow is it kosher for US to continue buying enriched uranium from a sanctioned Russia to meet its energy needs, while frowning upon India\u2019s purchase of Russian oil to fuel its growing economy? MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal pointed out in a tweet on Monday that US had nudged India to buy more Russian oil at the start of the war \u201cfor strengthening global energy markets\u2019 stability\u201d. Europe was the biggest buyer of Russian oil and gas then, and for it to take a righteous stand, \u201ctraditional supplies were diverted to Europe\u201d. India at that time sourced less than 1% of crude from Russia. By making the switch, it spared the world an inflationary wave so soon after the pandemic.\u00a0\nAs things stand, India\u2019s saving not more than $2bn a year by buying discounted Russian oil. It can pivot to West Asian suppliers again, but everybody \u2013 including US \u2013 will then feel inflationary pain. Trump shouldn\u2019t forget that while trying to armtwist India into a trade deal. \n\n",

        "full_article": "Natural disasters visit Uttarakhand regularly. It excels in worsening their toll rashly\nNo, it wasn\u2019t nearly as bad as 2013. But it was quite terrifying. The visuals of a swollen, angry river sweeping away scores of buildings as if they were bathtub toys, are still playing on repeat on TV. However frequent natural disasters may unfortunately be, sometimes the images set one apart. That\u2019s the case with yesterday\u2019s cloudburst in Uttarkashi. It led to flash floods in the high altitude villages of Dharali. This extreme weather event occurs in a small area and is rarely predicted by weather monitoring systems. IMD had given an \u201cextremely heavy\u201d rainfall warning for several districts in the state. But what we see in those terrifying visuals is how a cloudburst can wreak destruction in a mountainous region, gaining inordinate power through valleys and steep slopes, in a way impossible to control.\nThe other thing impossible to miss is how abundantly construction was sitting in the riverbed, as if with no sense of the river\u2019s nature and its rights of passage. In the moment that one gasped and feared that 2013 was being repeated, everything that happened then, from which the state was supposed to emerge chastened and reformed, streamed in one\u2019s mind. That June, the cloudburst sent such flash floods down Kedarnath to Rishikesh, that thousands of villages suffered and over 5,000 people went missing. There was hyper focus on how unregulated real estate development had exponentially worsened the toll that the natural disaster anyway would have taken. Nature has hardly stopped serving such warnings. The 2021 glacial lake outburst flood that tore into Chamoli and the 2023 subsidence in Joshimath were two biggies, for example.\u00a0\nBut highrises to fancy villas keep going up in river beds. Builders make hay while people lose their lives and investments. Uttarakhand is crying for a govt that takes sustainable development seriously. It\u2019s never had one.\u00a0\n\n",

        "full_article": "A single word scores a hat trick by having a trio of different meanings in the country\u00a0\nEnglish is a very hard working language. It\u2019s forever rolling up its sleeves and borrowing words from other languages, without so much as a by your leave, to make its own.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s pinched Guru, Karma, and Bungalow, to name only a few, from Hindi. English is also forever inventing new words to add to its repertoire.\u00a0\nRecent examples include chillax, a combination of chill and relax; doomscrolling, obsessively reading and looking at negative news; awesomesauce, something that is extremely good; and truthiness, something that sounds true but has no evidence to back it.\u00a0\nThanks to its unceasing labour,\u00a0English has possibly the largest number of words in its lexicon compared with all other languages, with its dictionaries variously listing between 500,000 and as many as a million words, though only about 20,000 are in average daily use.\u00a0\nThe most widely spoken language in the world with an estimated 1.5bn users, English is also skilled at multitasking, making many of its words sound the same but have several meanings.\u00a0\nSuch words include dog, which is an animal of the canine species, or it could be a verb that means to follow someone or something.\u00a0\nSome words in English can also have even three meanings, and could be called verbal triplets. A verbal triplet of particular relevance to contemporary India is the word \u2018gag\u2019.\u00a0\nGag can mean a joke, a witticism, a one-liner, or other expression of humour, spoken or written. Gag can also mean to prevent one from speaking or expressing oneself by inserting a metaphoric gag in one\u2019s metaphoric mouth.\u00a0\nAnd as increasingly more and more gags of the first kind are charged with hurting the religious, ideological, or any other sensibilities of various sections of people, gags of the second kind are more and more frequently and vigorously employed.\u00a0\nThis gagging of gags might induce gagsters, to coin a word, to feel an urge to perform a third kind of gag, which means to want to vomit. And that\u2019s no truthiness.\u00a0And certainly no awesomesauce.\u00a0\n\n",

Ironically, it is the main users of the port facilities who in most cases, get in the way. So, one is hardly surprised when the Chittagong Port Authority (CPA), the body that manages, maintains and looks after the governance and operation of the seaport, had to issue a notice threatening its main users with penal rent to be charged unless they promptly clear port yards. Notably, of late, the port's normal operation is being severely hampered as the volume of empty containers has surpassed its capacity many times over. In consequence, it is causing delay in key operations like delivery of the imported FCL (full container load) goods as well as stacking and storing of freshly unloaded containers. Since repeated warnings have fallen on deaf ears, the CPA has been constrained to declare in a notification August 7 as the cutoff date to clean up the yard following which, it warned, the section 160 of Regulations for Working of Chittagong Port (Cargo and Container) 2001, would come into force. Meanwhile, as notified, the port authority would monitor progress, if any, of the cleanup work. \nThere is no question that the port authority, if it is to continue serving its users, has to take, if necessary, harsh measures to keep the port's container storage space clean and in order. One would like to believe that the CPA's deadline would be met by the port users sine it is they who would ultimately suffer if the clogged up yards bring the port's normal activities to a standstill to the detriment of the country's entire external trade. It's indeed unfortunate that a humongous pile of empty containers was lying on the port's storage yard putting huge obstacles in the way of its normal functioning. It is worth noting that the Chittagong Port has a combined container storage capacity of 53, 518 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units) in its several storage yards. That means already large portion of the port's entire container storage capacity has been adversely occupied by the empty boxes yet to be shifted to the off-docks. So, one would earnestly like to hope that the CPA's cleaning up deadline as notified would not go unheeded by its stakeholders. Currently, the storage rent for empty containers stands at USD6 per TEU per day for the first seven days and jumps to USD12 per TEU from the 8th to 20th day of container yard usage and USD24 per TEU per day thereafter. In that case, if any action is taken by CPA after the passage of the deadline, it should be justified and any clamouring from any user feeling aggrieved at it should not stand to reason. \nSince last March, the CPA has been imposing four times the usual store rent on cargo containers so that the congestion of the cargo storage space could be eased. But no visible move has been made so far by the stakeholders concerned to keep the port's container storage space free from empty containers. In the final analysis, in an arrangement where cooperation between the provider and recipient of service should be the basis of work ethic, resorting to any executive or legal action is the last option.\nSo, it is in the interest of all the parties, the port users and the CPA, that they would come together and agree towards further enhancing the country's premier port's service giving potential.\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

While the meteoric rise of the industry stirred by massive manual activities is highly risk-prone and environment-degrading, its contribution in terms of employment and feeding the country's booming steel and re-rolling mills can hardly be over exaggerated. \nWhile the sector offers employment to around three hundred thousand workers, it has the proven capacity of supporting a vast array of heavy and light engineering industries. Iron rods and billets recycled from ship scraps, believed to be of high quality, meet a major portion of domestic requirement in the construction sector. Old ships meet 80 per cent of the demand of raw materials in the rerolling mills. Experts have opined that Bangladesh is a unique place for ship-breaking and ship-recycling as nearly all the products available from dismantled ships are being used locally. Moreover, as the advanced countries have given up on ship breaking because of the high cost of labour and accompanying compliance issues, ship breaking has all the prospects to thrive in countries like Bangladesh. It is thus of critical importance for those directly associated with the sector to make sure that the country is well poised to reap the gains from the opportunities offered by it. And this can only be done if the challenges associated with the task are met in a befitting manner. \nThe economic value of ship scrapping cannot be questioned, but there are serious concerns over safety and environmental hazards. There are threats too from potential sources of supply, such as the Norwegian Ship Owners' Association (NSA), not to allow recycling of their ships in Bangladesh, unless it is done in keeping with the Hong Kong International Convention for 'Safe and Environmentally Sound' recycling of ships. The Norwegian stand appears to be further reinforced by a reported move of the European Union, which accounts for 20 per cent of the total scrap vessels sold around the world, to ban export of scrap ships to Bangladesh and few other neighbouring countries. These, no doubt, are grave signals to reckon with, if the country is to see its ship breaking industry continue and thrive given the prospects. The concerns are not just expressions of anxiety as they used to be in the past, but are now clearly action-driven meant to cause a drastic cut in the availability of scrap vessels to be dismantled for recycling. \nThe fallouts have already begun to manifest. Currently, the country's ship-breaking industry is facing significant headwinds, with imports of scrapped vessels plunging by 36 per cent in the first half of 2025. The setback is largely due to new regulatory requirements, delayed clearances, and procedural complications under a stricter global compliance framework.\nThe country imported a total of 57 end-of-life ships during the January-June period this year, down from 89 ships in the same period of 2024, according to data released by the NGO Shipbreaking Platform (NSP), a global coalition advocating for safer and greener dismantling practices. Annual data also reflects a broader slowdown. Bangladesh dismantled 130 vessels in 2024, compared to 170 in 2023, 122 in 2022, and 254 in 2021. The number stood at 144 in 2020, 236 in 2019, and 185 in 2018. Industry insiders blame the sharp drop on the absence of DASR (Document of Authorisation to Conduct Ship Recycling), which is now mandatory under the HKC regime.\nLately it has been learnt that the Ministry of Industries has asked Bangladesh Ship Recycling Board (BSRB) to take necessary measures to issue DASR in favour of compliant yards for operating their ship recycling activities in line with the Hong Kong Convention. To this effect, the ministry last week issued a notification, acknowledging the necessity of issuance of the DASR after the final approval of the Ship Recycling Facilities Plan (SRFP) under the Hong Kong Convention.\nBangladesh had ratified the Hong Kong Convention in 2023, which came into force on June 26. Such a move came following a recent appeal from the ship breakers and recyclers in this regard. In this situation, until the laws, rules and policies are updated to implement the Hong Kong Convention, it is highly important to take necessary measures to issue DASR in favour of compliant yards to conduct ship recycling activities in line with the Convention. According to sources, the BSRB has decided to issue the DASR and requested ship recycling facilities (SRF) to apply for the same. The DASR will be issued to yards, SRF plans of those have got approval from industries ministry, a source said. However, the SRFs those are yet to be compliant in line with the Convention and do not receive the SOC (statement of compliance) will require to submit a transitional plan with a gap analysis of progress within the stipulated timeframe by an accredited organisation. According to the sector insiders, a total of 14 ship-breaking yards are compliant, while more than a dozen are in the process of fulfilling the requirements. Some seven Bangladeshi yards have so far obtained SoC with the Hong Kong Convention, according to NSP (NGO Shipbreaking Platform), a global coalition advocating for safer and greener dismantling practices.\nGiven the situation, expediting compliance with the Hong Kong convention demands urgent attention.\nwasiahmed.bd@gmail.com\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

As AI systems grow in intelligence and autonomy, their impact on the global job market is becoming increasingly profound, raising optimism and concern.\nOn the positive side, AI is unlocking new frontiers of innovation. From automating mundane tasks to improving healthcare, logistics, finance, and agriculture decision-making, AI can boost productivity and create more efficient, data-driven economies. New job opportunities are emerging in fields like machine learning, AI ethics, data analysis, and robotic engineering -- roles that didn't even exist a decade ago. The AI era promises exciting and high-paying career prospects for those prepared with the right skills.\nHowever, this technological progress also comes with real challenges. Many traditional jobs, especially those involving repetitive or rule-based tasks, risk being replaced by machines. Truck drivers, retail workers, call center agents, and even professional services like law and accounting are seeing early signs of AI-driven disruption. According to recent global workforce studies, millions of jobs could be displaced in the coming years if effective strategies aren't implemented.\nThis raises a crucial question: Are we preparing our workforce for this transition? Unfortunately, the answer is often no. Educational institutions are struggling to keep up with the pace of change, and many current workers lack access to the retraining programs needed to adapt. Without urgent and coordinated efforts, we risk widening the gap between those who can benefit from AI and those who will be left behind.\nThe solution lies in proactive reskilling, digital education investment, and lifelong learning commitment. Governments must support initiatives that equip workers with technical and soft skills, while companies should be held accountable for ethical AI deployment that prioritizes people over pure profit. At the same time, society must place greater value on unique human abilities like empathy, creativity, collaboration, and critical thinking that no machine can truly replicate.\nThe AI revolution is not inherently good or bad, but a tool. Its impact will depend on how wisely and ethically we use it. By addressing the challenges head-on and putting people at the center of this transformation, we can shape a future where AI enhances human potential rather than diminishes it.\nDevjoti Ghosh Aion\nDepartment of Finance and Marketing\nNorth South University\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

And it's not just limited to the rainy season-fatalities from snakebites are reported throughout the year, particularly in rural areas. These regions often suffer from a lack of awareness, deep-rooted superstitions, and a reluctance to seek modern medical treatment. Many victims turn to traditional healers or shamans instead of going to hospitals, which increases the risk of death due to improper or delayed treatment.\nUnfortunately, the supply of antivenom in rural hospitals remains far below actual demand. There is also no clear or coordinated plan in place to address this issue. In addition, widespread misconceptions about snakebites further discourage people from seeking proper medical care.\nTo reduce the mortality rate from snakebites, awareness campaigns about first-aid treatment must be promoted at union health centres and community clinic levels. An adequate supply of antivenom for venomous snakebites must be ensured. Stockpiles of antivenom should be increased at village-based clinics and government hospitals. Ultimately, raising public awareness is key to addressing this ongoing problem.\nUmme Sabaina Sultana\nStudent, Department of Sociology\nUniversity of Rajshahi\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
