The general public, however, would not be too thrilled. There is some good news for them, but also a significant dose of pain. Food inflation, for example, saw a significant easing, although that too is a seasonal effect rather than a structural one. Food and beverage prices contracted 0.2% in June 2025 on a high base of 8.4% in June last year. Key items such as vegetables, pulses, spices and meat saw prices falling in June compared to their levels last year. But food is not all that people spend their money on. The data reveal that there were several items and services of common consumption that saw inflation quickening in June. The education and stationery segment saw inflation quicken to 4.4% in June, the highest in 15 months. This was driven by a jump in the prices of school, college, and private tuition. Inflation in the health-care category, too, was at a 15-month high in June. Compounding this, the personal care segment saw inflation jumping to a blistering 14.8% in June, the eighth month of double-digit inflation in the last nine months. Products such as soap, toothpaste, shampoo and sanitary napkins \u2014 items of daily or regular use and by no stretch luxuries \u2014 have become more expensive. So, overall, food is cheaper, but nearly everything else is more expensive.This leads to an important policy question, one that has been asked several times before: is the headline inflation data adequately capturing the price rise the average Indian faces? The food basket itself carries a 46% weight in the overall Consumer Price Index (CPI), meaning that any change in this category has an inordinate impact on the headline number. The recent Household Consumption Expenditure Surveys show that food comprises a much smaller share of about 30% in the expenditure of households. Bringing the CPI weight of food down to align with this will allow the overall CPI to be more representative. To be fair, that process is on, with the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation in the process of updating the CPI. The CPI base year \u2014 so far set as 2011-12 \u2014 is being updated to a more recent time period, and the weights of the different categories are also being revised. This update cannot happen fast enough, as even monetary policy is currently dependent on this outdated and unrepresentative measure. In the meantime, it is important not to get swayed by the fall in the headline number itself. The felt experience of the average Indian is described in the details, and it is still a painful one.\r Published - July 16, 2025 12:20 am IST\n                          Read  Comments \n                Copy link  \n                        \n            \n                    Email     \n                                \n                \n                Facebook   \n                        \n            \n                Twitter    \n                        \n            \n                Telegram     \n                        \n            \n                LinkedIn     \n                        \n            \n                WhatsApp\n                \n                        \n            \n                Reddit      \n                        \n            READ LATER\n                    Remove     \n                \n                SEE ALL         \n                PRINT\n            Related Topics\n        \n                        inflation and deflation\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        food\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        fruit and vegetable\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        meat\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        education\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        school\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        tuitions\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        health\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        food\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        India",

        "full_article": "In a welcome move, the Health Ministry has directed all government departments to display oil, sugar and trans-fat content in everyday Indian snacks such as samosas, jalebis, vada pavs and laddoos in a bid to highlight the health risks of their consumption on a regular basis. The campaign will be piloted in AIIMS Nagpur and then rolled out to other cities. The move comes two months after the CBSE directed all affiliated schools to establish \u2018sugar boards\u2019 to monitor and reduce the sugar intake of children. These will list information on the recommended daily sugar intake, the sugar content in commonly consumed foods, health risks associated with high sugar consumption, and healthier dietary alternatives. The initiatives have been driven by studies that provide evidence of increasing obesity trends in India. As in the NFHS data, obesity had increased from nearly 15% to 24% in men and from 12% to nearly 23% in women between 2005-06 and 2019-21. Since the amount of oil and sugar in Indian snacks is not apparent \u2014 and, hence, often overlooked \u2014 these initiatives will serve to fill the gap and act as \u201cvisual behavioural nudges\u201d, much like the pictorial warnings on tobacco products. However, building awareness alone cannot bring about behavioural changes, especially in the absence of essential legislative measures.Surprisingly, while the Health Ministry has targeted Indian snacks, nothing has been done over the years to introduce clear front-of-package labels to caution people about unhealthy packaged food items, and regulate the advertising, marketing and promotion of unhealthy food to children. Also, levying additional tax on food products with high levels of fat, sugar, and salt (HFSS) can further reduce consumption, as seen in some countries. As in the national multisectoral action plan for prevention and control of common non-communicable disease (2017-22), the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) Regulation was required to be amended for inclusion of front-of-pack labelling and detailed nutrient labelling. The FSSAI (Packaging and Labelling) Regulation was amended in 2020; on July 15, the Supreme Court of India again directed the agency to execute this label on packaged food. For front-of-pack labels on HFSS food and beverage products to become a reality, the FSSAI has to first define the upper limits for sugar, salt and total fat, which have not been finalised and approved so far. A 2022 study found that warning labels outperformed all other forms of front-of-pack labelling in identify unhealthy products. A study by the ICMR-NIN found that warning labels and nutri-star ratings helped deter the consumption of even moderately unhealthy foods. Measures to build awareness without essential legislative measures to curb unhealthy food intake will not be much more than symbolic.

Is the keen edge of greed the only, or even the major, motivation that induces the migrant to cut loose the main-stay anchor of home and chance the terra incognita of foreign shores?\nCould there be, apart from the pull factor of financial benefit, also a push impetus that impels those who quit India?\nThe greater part of the Great Indian Diaspora is composed of low-skilled labour drawn by the prospect of monetary gain. \u00a0But the highly-educated, who turn their backs on their home country, might have other reasons for doing so.\nCould these include a desperation to forsake a climate in which, increasingly, the innovative and the unconventional are stifled by sectarian ideology, and a once shared inclusive identity is fragmented\u00a0with exclusionary fissures of creed, caste and language?\nLove for one\u2019s country is laudable, as is the reciprocal love the country must bear for all those who call it home, and not just for those who constitute a brute majority.\n\n",

But here\u2019s the thing \u2014 these cars are really expensive (starting at \u20b961 lakh), so only a few people can afford them. That\u2019s why experts think Tesla might sell just 200 to 300 cars a month in India. That\u2019s tiny compared to the 1.8 million cars it sold around the world last year!\nSo, why is Tesla even coming now?\nWell, Musk actually showed interest in India almost 10 years ago, even saying that Tesla might build a big car factory here. That could have created jobs and made Tesla cars more affordable in India. But instead, he built a factory in China. Now, Tesla is just testing the Indian market with a few cars \u2014 and entering a space where other luxury car brands like BMW and Mercedes are already doing well.\nBack in 2016, many rich Indians were excited and even booked Tesla\u2019s Model 3 online. But those cars never arrived. Still, people remained big fans of the brand.\nIn short: Tesla has great brand power in India. But it came too late, and without a real plan. If Musk had moved faster and built cars in India years ago, things might have gone much better \u2014 for both him and the country.\n\n",

Elon Musk, who\u2019s quoted from The Tempest before, might have heard. His Tesla \u201ctook the current\u201d on Tuesday to launch its India operation. The world\u2019s largest manufacturer of battery-electric cars \u2013 Chinese BYD was a sliver behind in 2024 \u2013 now has a showroom in Mumbai, and little more. Reports say six fully built Tesla Model Ys are on the way from Shanghai. On-road prices start around \u20b961L, putting the midsize SUV in the luxury segment, where the likes of Mercedes, BMW and Volvo will keep it company. But this segment amounted to only 50,000 units last year, of which 75% were petrol or diesel vehicles. And sales in the first six months of 2025 have been weak. Tesla\u2019s fighting for a pie that amounts to 10,000-12,000 units per year, and analysts expect it to sell not more than 200-300 units per month. Which, considering that it sold about 1.8mn cars globally in 2024, is nothing.\nSo, what\u2019s Musk\u2019s plan really? Some see it as an attempt to gauge the Indian market. As far as brand-building goes, Tesla is too well-known already. Back in 2016, when it was a much smaller company, and Musk\u2019s net worth was less than $12bn, Indian tycoons proudly announced they had booked the newly launched Model 3 online. The cars didn\u2019t materialise, but fans kept the faith. Musk also maintained India was on his mind: \u201cHoping for summer this year (2017)\u201d. Winter arrived, and one man imported a model X on his own \u2013 its eight-year battery warranty would be running out now. So, brand strength has never been Tesla\u2019s problem. What it needs is a business plan, and 10 years ago Musk had a stronger one. \u201cGiven high local demand, a Gigafactory in India would probably make sense in the long term,\u201d he tweeted in Oct 2015, years before he set up that factory in Shanghai instead. It was a good idea, which, \u201ctaken at the flood\u201d may have led to better fortune for both India and Musk.\n\n",

But even though some new young leaders are stepping up, the old problems are still around \u2014 people are talking more about caste (which group you belong to by birth) and religion than about things like jobs, health, or schools.\nThe current Chief Minister, Nitish Kumar, has been around a long time and usually looks confident. But now he\u2019s facing a tough situation. A younger politician, Chirag Paswan, wants to be the next CM (Chief Minister).

Reports published in this paper on the basis of information from the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB) and the city's kitchen markets, the prices of this basic staple of all categories increased by Tk6.0 to Tk10 a kilogram last month. Even the coarser variety of rice, which is consumed mainly by the low-income people, was selling between Tk 56 and Tk 58 per kg.\nWhy should the prices go up when its import by the private sector was enjoying full duty waiver? Moreover, being the harvesting season of Boro rice, the major winter crop of Bangladesh, there was abundant supply of rice in the market. Neither the traders in the retail market nor experts on essentials' market value chain could come up with any credible explanation of this strange behaviour of the country's rice market. However, one answer to this riddle was, as always, the syndicates comprising mainly of the millers, big importers and corporate operators in the rice market. No doubt there were elements of truth in such suggestions since there has to be some reason for such rice price volatility. There is still no let up in the soaring rice price and new arguments are being advanced to explain away the matter. It is that the zero-duty facility for rice import in force between October 2024 and May 2025, which was introduced to counterbalance the damage caused to Aman crop in the wake of the floods of August 2024, is now over. So, the original rate of 62.5 duty on rice import has returned discouraging any further import of rice by the private sector. Now the finger is being pointed at the freshly discovered culprit -- the restrictive import duty! \nExperts as well as rice traders favour relaxation of the duty on rice import again, preferably to the pre-June 2025 level at zero per cent. But going by previous experience there is no guarantee that duty waiver will leave any impact on the rice price regime in the market. More so, because given the adequate stock of rice in the government silos and the post-boro harvest realities, there should be no supply shortage to justify any reduction of duty or its outright waiver so far as rice import is concerned. Since, according to reports, the Boro production this year was the highest ever at 20.6 million, any fear of supply crisis would be misplaced. The Directorate-General of Food (DGoF), on the other hand, says it has a stock of 1.8 million tonnes of foodgrains, of which rice constitutes the lion's share. Meanwhile, the government's drive of rice purchase is ongoing. To all appearances, these positive factors have no impact on the rice maeket.\nThen, what other options are left for the government to control the prevailing volatility of the rice market, which has a direct bearing on the rate of inflation and hence the cost of living? Most importantly, the very low-income and those without any income, the vulnerable segments of society, have to be protected by all means. That involves extending direct government support to those families. Also, to avert any unexplained bigger crisis, the government intervention in the rice market in the form of open market sales (OMS) should be in place. At the same time, strict market monitoring and penalising hoarders and price manipulators should continue. Since floods are common in the rainy season, the government must also be fully prepared to meet any flood-related emergency arising in the coming days.\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "full_article": "\n / EDITORIAL\n   Wasi Ahmed   |  \n       July 16, 2025 00:00:00  \n\nIn the light of the latest US tariff salvo on Bangladesh exports, questions are being raised over what Bangladesh can realistically offer to lower the steep duties imposed by the Trump administration. Although US officials have said that negotiation channels remain open for discussions on reciprocal tariff parity, prospects of a significant turnaround appear slim, under the circumstances.\nFollowing the imposition of a 37 per cent reciprocal tariff on April 3, Bangladesh proposed to lower import duties on a range of US-origin products. However, the move evidently fell short of meeting the Trump administration's expectations. A subsequent revision of the proposed sectoral tariff to 35 per cent also failed to shift the dynamics. For Bangladeshi exporters, who already face around 15 per cent tariff when shipping to the US -- the country's largest export destination-the newly announced 35 per cent surcharge would take the total duty to 50-51 per cent, effective from August.\nFinance Adviser Dr. Salehuddin Ahmed, speaking to the press following the announcement, stated that the proposed 35 per cent tariff was not yet final and that a resolution could still be achieved through direct bilateral negotiations. Meanwhile, the Commerce Adviser, who led a small delegation for talks with the USTR earlier this week, informed the media yesterday that some time had been secured from the U.S. side to work towards a mutually acceptable position. It remains to be seen what strategic options Bangladesh has at its disposal to steer the situation in its favour. \nWhat has complicated matters is the comparative advantage granted to Vietnam -- a key competitor in the garment sector -- which has secured a flat 20 per cent tariff on its exports to the US. This gives Vietnam a pronounced edge over Bangladesh in the American market. The trade imbalance between Bangladesh and the US currently stands at approximately $6.2 billion, while Vietnam's trade surplus with the US is a staggering $125 billion. Yet, Washington has agreed to a favourable deal with Hanoi. One likely reason is the US-Vietnam agreement that pairs the 20 per cent tariff on garments with zero-duty access for American goods into Vietnam. Additionally, while transshipment of Chinese goods through Vietnam would attract a 40 per cent tariff, this still undercuts the rates Bangladesh might face if negotiations collapse.\nOther countries such as Indonesia and South Africa also appear to have struck more favourable terms than Bangladesh. Among the 14 countries listed in the latest US tariff announcements, only four are in a weaker position. Some observers argue that Bangladesh government squandered the three-month window following the initial April announcement to negotiate a better outcome. Professor Mustafizur Rahman, distinguished fellow at the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), has voiced disappointment, noting that although Bangladesh was the first to begin discussions with the USTR, the outcome has been disappointing. He pointed out that negotiations have only managed a 2-percentage point reduction in the additional tariff -- an outcome that could severely damage export competitiveness.\nThis raises a critical question: what, if anything, can Bangladesh offer to further reduce the tariff to a more reasonable level? If, as speculated, the US is seeking to increase its exports of aircraft, cotton, food grains, LNG, and military hardware to Bangladesh in a bid to bridge the trade gap, is Dhaka prepared to respond affirmatively or take steps in that direction?\nIn 2024, Bangladesh exported about $8.4 billion worth of goods to the US, of which $7.34 billion came from the readymade garment sector. On the other hand, US exports to Bangladesh stood at just $2.2 billion, leaving a trade gap of $6.2 billion. Would a pledge from Bangladesh to import more American goods suffice? Could the government consider granting zero-tariff access to US exports across the board?\nThe Vietnam deal is attractive on paper. But the fact remains Vietnam cannot meet the total demand for garments in the US. Bangladesh, unlike Vietnam, has pursued negotiations under a multilateral framework, hoping to secure lower duties based on WTO's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) principles. However, the US appears more inclined towards bilateral deals that blend trade considerations with strategic partnerships.\nIf the worst-case scenario unfolds and Bangladesh is subjected to an effective tariff rate exceeding 50 per cent, many suppliers -- who currently export between 40 and 80 per cent of their output to the US -- could be pushed to the brink. With profit margins in the apparel industry already wafer-thin and operational costs steadily rising, such a tariff hike would make it increasingly difficult for many exporters to sustain their businesses. At the current 15 per cent rate, the apparel sector already pays over $1.0 billion annually in tariffs. A hike to more than 50 per cent could result in significantly higher losses -- not just for Bangladeshi exporters, but also for US brands and consumers. Higher costs at the retail end could trigger inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions.\nIt is important to recognise that this is not just a trade negotiation -- it is entangled with geopolitics. The limited political engagement between Dhaka and Washington may be working against Bangladesh's interests. Without closer ties to the Trump administration's core political constituencies, trade negotiations alone may not suffice. Bangladesh must urgently recalibrate its strategy. This includes leveraging US-based lobby groups, engaging American retailers, and reaching out to sourcing associations who rely on Bangladeshi goods. Business diplomacy needs to work in tandem with traditional diplomacy to navigate this complex situation.\nAt a time when global trade dynamics are shifting and geopolitical alliances are reshaping trade policies, Bangladesh cannot afford to be reactive. The stakes are high, and the time to act decisively is now.\nwasiahmed.bd@gmail.com\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

In Bangladesh, the corporate sector is gradually coming to terms with this cultural shift, even as many international organisations have already adopted hybrid or flexible work models as a permanent feature.\nWhat was initially perceived as a stopgap solution has demonstrated long-term advantages. These include improved work-life balance, increased employee productivity, reduced commuting stress, and lower operational costs for employers. Remote work has also opened up opportunities for individuals outside major cities, promoting greater inclusivity in the workforce.\nHowever, challenges persist-particularly in developing countries like ours. Limited digital infrastructure, unreliable internet access, difficulties in supervising remote employees, and concerns over data security continue to hinder the widespread adoption of remote work. Maintaining company culture and ensuring consistent team communication also remain complex issues.\nDespite these obstacles, Bangladesh is witnessing a gradual shift. Sectors such as IT, media, telecommunications, and finance are leading the way by piloting or implementing hybrid work models. This transition demands that Human Resources departments rethink performance evaluation metrics, introduce mental health and wellness support, and design effective virtual engagement strategies.\nTo ensure the sustainability of remote work in Bangladesh, several critical steps are required: clear policy frameworks, regular upskilling and training programmes, and targeted investments in reliable digital tools and platforms.\nIf embraced strategically, remote work holds the potential to enhance employee satisfaction and retention, reduce urban congestion and position Bangladeshi companies as modern, forward-thinking players in the global economy.\nSadia Arafin Maisha \nStudent\nNorth South University \nsadia.maisha@northsouth.edu\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Reckless speeding, dangerous overtaking, and blatant disregard for traffic rules have transformed our highways into death traps. What was once a rush to reach destinations has now become a perilous race with devastating consequences.\nEvery day, we witness innocent lives lost due to the irresponsible behaviour of drivers. Their obsession with speed-often driven by unrealistic trip targets, poor regulation, or simply sheer negligence-leads to fatal accidents that tear families apart. Parents lose their children, and children lose their entire families. The aftermath of a single accident can upend lives: the death of a breadwinner may halt a child's education, trigger financial collapse, and push a family into poverty.\nThese are not merely individual or family tragedies-they are national losses. Bangladesh loses skilled workers, students, professionals, and future contributors to its economy and society. The psychological and economic toll is immeasurable.\nDespite these horrific realities, the level of enforcement remains alarmingly inadequate. The Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA), the police, highway patrol, and other relevant agencies must urgently come together to launch a coordinated and zero-tolerance campaign against reckless driving. Special attention must be given to curbing overspeeding, dangerous overtaking and unfit vehicles. Technology like speed cameras, dash cams and GPS monitoring must be adopted widely. Equally crucial is raising awareness through public campaigns and driver education.\nThe culture of impunity must end. Accountability and consequences must replace indifference and negligence. Road safety is no privilege, it is a right of every citizen.\nLet us act now firmly and collectively so that no more lives are lost to this needless and preventable race. We owe it to the victims, and to the future of our nation.\nProgga Das\nStudent, Department of Economics\nEden Mohila College\nproggadas2005@gmail.com\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
