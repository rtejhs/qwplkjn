Ms. Gupta has risen through the ranks of the Sangh Parivar and won Delhi University Students Union and municipal elections, before being elected to the Assembly from Shalimar Bagh. She has held positions in the party and its frontal organisations. Now, entrusted with the position of the Chief Minister, Ms. Gupta, 50, has her task cut out. She has to balance community and sectional interests within the party, command authority over the bureaucracy, and balance multiple power centres within the unique and complex governance architecture of Delhi. All levels of the government in Delhi are now under the control of the BJP, which might improve governance in the city. Ms. Gupta is the fourth woman Chief Minister of Delhi, the second woman Chief Minister of Delhi from the BJP, and the only woman among the party\u2019s 14 Chief Ministers across India. A woman in the top post allows the BJP to deflect other factional claims in the party, and possibly boosts its popular image. Ms. Gupta also represents the trader bania community which has been a bedrock of the BJP\u2019s politics in Delhi for decades. The new leader ticks many boxes for the party, and her success depends on how she grows into the challenging role.The BJP has tried to balance caste and community representation in the new Council of Ministers. In Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma, the party has found someone to represent the Jat community, in Manjinder Singh Sirsa, the Sikh community, in Ashish Sood, the Punjabi Hindu community, in Ravinder Indraj Singh, Dalits, in Kapil Mishra, Brahmins, and in Pankaj Kumar Singh, the Purvanchali community. The new government has a multitude of governance challenges awaiting it. The problems of air and water pollution are issues that need a solution that go beyond the boundaries of Delhi; issues such as law and order are under the purview of the Union Home Ministry. Ms. Gupta\u2019s experience of being a three-term municipal councillor could help, as would the fact that the neighbouring Haryana and Uttar Pradesh also have BJP governments. The BJP has returned to power in the national capital after 26 years, having offered the electorate a raft of welfare schemes to achieve that. There are the issues of unemployment and underemployment, and affordable housing and infrastructure that require the government\u2019s attention.

        "full_article": "Official estimates suggest that around 45 crore visitors, nearly a third of India\u2019s population, have already been to Prayagraj for the Maha Kumbh Mela, which began in mid-January. With such a massive influx, even a small percentage of individuals who carry microbes could trigger extensive chains of disease transmission. The Ganga at Prayagraj, where devotees not only have ritual baths but also drink the water, inevitably becomes a complex receptacle of microbiomes. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), which is responsible for monitoring and controlling air, water and land pollution, has been assessing water quality at Prayagraj since the festival began. Its reports, which are publicly accessible, present a mixed picture. On January 14, which was Makar Sankranti, one of the most auspicious bathing days, faecal coliform levels, a key indicator of contamination from human and animal waste, were at a high \u2014 nearly 11,000 units at the Sangam Ghat, which is more than four times the permissible limit of 2,500 units. At the Old Naini Bridge Ghat, along the Yamuna, the count was even higher, at 33,000 units. However, on other days, these numbers dropped to as low as 200 and 780 units. Similar fluctuations were observed for other parameters of water quality such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and dissolved oxygen (DO). A CPCB report submitted to the National Green Tribunal on February 3 stated that the water quality on January 12-13, 2025 was not fit for bathing, let alone drinking, despite bathing having a higher tolerance limit. However, the report also noted a reduction in organic pollution due to freshwater intrusion upstream. It further observed that the sheer number of people bathing in the river during the Maha Kumbh Mela, particularly on auspicious days, led to an inevitable spike in faecal contamination.These fluctuations are not exclusive to the Kumbh Mela. Routine monitoring of water quality by the CPCB has consistently recorded similar patterns, reinforcing the fact that, regardless of what the festival may be, water in the Ganga at Prayagraj is not fit for consumption, whether as a few drops or bucketful. The river\u2019s suitability for bathing fluctuates based on water flow and dilution. Considering these adverse findings, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath\u2019s dismissal of this scientific data as \u201cbaseless\u201d is misleading. The National Mission for Clean Ganga is based on a sustained effort to restore the river\u2019s health, and Uttar Pradesh, its largest beneficiary, must prioritise continuous cleanup efforts instead of undermining legitimate pollution concerns. The Kumbh Mela highlights the urgent need for long-term solutions, not denialism. Science can come to the aid of the faithful; it is in no one\u2019s interest to undermine scientific findings in the name of encouraging a spiritual journey.

There are some who claim that TV, smartphones, and other digital devices have virtually rung the death knell of the morning paper.\nHowever, to paraphrase Mark Twain\u2019s remark, the news of the newspaper\u2019s death is highly exaggerated.\nThis was made evident to me a week ago when I received an email asking for my assistance in getting a TOI subscription for a young would-be reader of the paper.\nThe sender of the mail wrote that while visiting a Jain temple in a small village in Bihar\u2019s Nalanda district, he had met a young boy, Sanket, a student at a local school and the son of a temple worker, who had shown a keen interest in improving his English language skills.\nImpressed by the boy\u2019s eagerness to get a better grasp of the language, the visitor promised to get a TOI subscription for the youngster.\nThis was the background of the mail I received. I made enquiries in the circulation department and found that it would be prohibitively expensive to get a single copy of the paper to the remote address given in the email.\nThe Delhi resident editor of TOI suggested that an online subscription to the paper would solve the problem, and give the young reader access to all 50-odd editions of the paper.\nI conveyed this to my correspondent, who wrote back saying that the boy would prefer the tangible immediacy of the paper edition to the digital version. The writer provided an alternative, more accessible, address for the paper\u2019s delivery from where the boy\u2019s father could go and collect it.\nI\u2019ve just received a mail that the Patna edition of TOI has managed, for the first time ever, to get an English language newspaper to reach Sanket\u2019s home. My correspondent writes: \u201cSanket now knows who the prime minister of India is, and who is the president of US.\u201d The print medium dead? Ask Sanket.\u00a0\n\n",

        "full_article": "GOI and Tamil Nadu are taking up the wrong language cause. They should put students before politics\nEverything changes, nothing changes. Half a century ago, the Centre and Chennai were at loggerheads over the three-language policy. They are at it again. Morarji Desai and Annadurai are long gone, but those same roles are being essayed by Dharmendra Pradhan and Stalin. GOI is still saying Tamil Nadu must come to terms with the Constitution, Tamil Nadu is still saying GOI mustn\u2019t do Hindi imposition. One thing they are on the same page on? High decibel politics. Never mind that confrontational posturing does little for students in whose name it\u2019s being done.\nThere\u2019s always been a broad sentiment in TN that forcing Hindi upon its students would both be an unnecessary burden and a cultural \u2018assault\u2019. Against this backdrop, the Centre withholding Tamil Nadu\u2019s central share of Samagra Shiksha funds until it falls in line on the language issue, is untenable. First, because it disrespects federalism. But even more importantly, because educational outcomes alone should be the yardstick in such matters. On this front, the latest Aser report reveals 36% of Class 5 govt school students in Tamil Nadu can read a Class 2-level text, and 21% can do division. This compares to 49% and 31% at the nationwide level, respectively. Obviously the state is underperforming relative to its wealth. But non-release of central funds isn\u2019t the solution.\nMeanwhile, with one side standing for Hindi and the other for Tamil, who will stand for English? Parents scrounging to send their children to \u2018English-medium\u2019 schools tells the critical truth about aspirations across India. This is also where we have some advantage over peer countries. But they aren\u2019t sitting idle about it. In Philippines, for example, there\u2019s a proposal to ban Filipino dubbing of English-language films and TV shows to improve English proficiency. If India\u2019s political class is sincerely concerned for students, it should take up the cause of English.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Delhi\u2019s new CM must focus on basics in a city in shambles. And she must respect its diversity\nDelhi\u2019s new CM Rekha Gupta will not be burdened by procedural challenges her predecessor faced. She has GOI and L-G\u2019s support. Tri-state NCR has BJP govts in every state. This makes work easier but also majorly raises expectations. Scrutiny will be sharper, given she\u2019ll govern the nation\u2019s capital, and given the city\u2019s dire straits. Her priorities must focus on quality-of-life basics: roads, Yamuna, drainage network and air quality.\nDelhi, as is to be expected, attracts an unceasing flow of migrants across strata flowing in daily by air, train and road. Its roads, public transport and air quality must be seen as a composite to deliver real change. Poorly designed and unmaintained roads remain a nightmare. Ill-conceived new roads take years to complete, their construction becomes a chokehold on daily commute, driving up costs and air pollution.\nPrivate parties dominate public transport, inefficient bus routes push commuters to use their own wheels. Two-wheeler daredevilry is skyhigh thanks to the burgeoning gig economy. Vehicles and road construction contribute to Delhi\u2019s air pollution crisis. All in all, movement of people is as cumbersome as it is inefficient. Movement within NCR has restrictions and tolls that defeat its purpose.\nRevival of Yamuna and its waterfront has so far been many Delhi govts\u2019 fantasy game. No govt has come anywhere close to cleaning the river. Kolkata and Ahmedabad have spruced up their riverfronts, making them not only tourist attractions, but a much-needed go-to quiet public space for the city\u2019s residents. The calming effect of a river in flow cannot be overstated \u2013 but parched Delhi has only been fed false promises for decades. This will be a tough task for Gupta.\nDelhi is now synonymous with water on its roads, even after a splash of rain. That mostly happens when drains overflow. An overhaul of the decades-old drainage network has been underway for well over a decade. An IIT-designed revamped drainage master plan was discarded. New processes for surveys of the drainage network are reportedly underway. Suffice to say that\u2019s much water under the bridge.\nFinally, a city is as progressive as its people. Delhi\u2019s a magnet for all kinds of people, professionals to daily wagers, from across the country. Listen to what they want \u2013 their different lifestyle choices and aspirations. They, along with the colourful spring splendour of hardy bougainvillea make Delhi what it is \u2013 a tough-spirited capital of freedoms.\u00a0\n\n",

        "full_article": "Authored by Ananda Tirtha Dasa\nIndividuals often encounter persons whose behaviour challenges patience and principles. These individuals may slander, belittle efforts, or bask in the glow of pomp. These moments test not only resolve but also a sense of purpose.\nWhat do you think should be done in such situations? It is tempting to react emotionally, to fight back against every insult or injustice. Yet this approach often leads to exhaustion, pulling one into a vortex of negativity. However, another way requires a deeper understanding of oneself and a shift in perspective.\nWhen confronted with unreasonable people, the first instinct is often to confront or compete. This \u2018fight mode\u2019 seems like a natural response: focusing on their every word and action, crafting rebuttals, and defending oneself. But such a path, while momentarily satisfying, can become an obsession. It drains energy, clouds judgment, and shifts life\u2019s focus to something external and temporary.\nThe Bhagwad Gita offers an alternative perspective rooted in faith and inner transformation. Krishn speaks of the power of conscious alignment with the Divine, assuring that his grace can overcome obstacles. The challenge is not to control external circumstances but to redirect energy inward towards growth, purpose, and trust in the higher plan.\nWhen viewed as a tool for self-improvement rather than a hindrance, adversity transforms into an opportunity for growth. The unreasonable person, however tricky, becomes like a weight at the gym. Lifting that weight strengthens resilience and faith. Faith, like a muscle, requires exercise to grow. Without trials, faith remains untested.\nThe unreasonable behaviours of others serve as a unique test, pushing one to rely not on \u2018the shifting sands of circumstances\u2019 but on a steady foundation of spiritual connection.\nHuman nature often gravitates toward negativity. When wronged, it is easy to fall into cycles of blame and self-pity. These thoughts, repeated over time, create chemical responses in the brain, forming habits that can be hard to break. This addiction to playing the victim, constantly replaying scenarios of being wronged, perpetuates negativity.\nTo break this cycle, the Gita teaches the recognition of true identity as eternal souls connected to the Supreme. When anchored in this understanding, thoughts shift. The same situation that once evoked despair now becomes manageable, even meaningful. Faith in this higher Truth rewires thinking, breaking the addiction to negativity.\nChoosing faith and integrity over conflict is not about passivity. It is an act of quiet strength, a declaration that external circumstances will not dictate inner peace. This path is not without effort but leads to freedom rooted in knowledge of support from something more significant.\nKrishn assures in the Gita: \u201cTo those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me.\u201d This assurance invites focus not on solving every problem but on remaining steadfast in trust and efforts. When the need to control outcomes is relinquished, and faith is aligned, a peace that surpasses all challenges is found. Unreasonable people may still exist, and obstacles will arise, but they no longer hold sway over the heart or mind.\nThe writer is a trustee, ISKCON\n\n",

        "full_article": "Before, when we spoke the truth, we were countered by the state and its agencies. Now, when we speak the truth, we are countered not by the state, but by lies, accusations without any proof, and tagging on the basis of hate narratives. Outrageous accusations are being made against legacy media without any evidence. In rare cases, when examples are cited, they are either false, taken out of context, distorted, or twisted to suit a predetermined goal. Thus, the media today is facing a new challenge in the post-truth era with an audience that is not used to such falsehood, half-truths and distortions, and as such is being victimised and misled.\nI am heartened by a recent comment by the chief adviser's press secretary, Shafiqul Alam, for his emphatic assertion of the need for a free media for a country's advancement. He also stressed the necessity to examine the media's role in distorting objective journalism and upholding the fascistic policy and governance structure of the past regime. He repeatedly stressed that power must always be held to account, and invited all media outlets to scrutinise his own government's performance in the spirit of total independence and professionalism.\nWe would like to commend him for his stance and focus on two aspects of his remarks: the need to examine our past, and to chalk out a path for the media's unfettered and independent future journey.\nAs for the past, it is true that most newspapers did not challenge the dictatorial regime of Sheikh Hasina during her rule of over 15 years. They either vigorously supported it or hid the truth, deflected issues that deserved criticism, or distorted facts so that the public wouldn't feel negative about the regime.\nThere were a few of us who defied all threats\u2014both public and undercover\u2014and carried on speaking truth to power. In the case of this newspaper, the antagonism burst into fury when we invited Prof Muhammad Yunus as chief guest at our 25th anniversary celebration in 2016. In the presence of thousands of invited guests, including 22 editors from South and Southeast Asia, a drama was enacted by several Awami League (AL) ministers who publicly staged a walkout, shouting condemnatory remarks, accusing this writer of having insulted them when Prof Yunus appeared on the stage to deliver the keynote speech. This newspaper was accused of \"launching\" (whatever that meant) Prof Yunus and giving him a huge national and international platform to work against the Hasina government. (Given her venomous remarks, relentless personal attacks, and fictitious cases against Yunus ever since, one can understand her fury against this newspaper and its editor.) From then on, we were her declared \"enemy,\" and she treated us as such. The avalanche of cases started within hours of that event using my remark on a TV show as a pretext.\nThis newspaper's editor was charged in 84 cases, 16 of which were for sedition. Several times on the floor of parliament, the former prime minister termed\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0and\u00a0Prothom Alo\u00a0\"anti-state,\" \"anti-Awami League,\" and \"anti-people.\" Many AL MPs castigated this newspaper in parliament, accusing us of \"indulging\" in all sorts of \"conspiracies.\" Even some non-AL MPs joined the castigation, demanding the closure of this newspaper and jailing of its editor. On one occasion, the former prime minister spoke for 21 minutes in parliament denigrating this newspaper's editor, casting doubt on his role as a freedom fighter and raising all sorts of false questions against him. A few years later, during the opening of the Padma Bridge, she falsely accused this writer of travelling to the US and meeting high-level State Department officials and the World Bank president to lobby for the cancellation of the WB loan, as part of Prof Yunus's alleged \"efforts\" (totally false) to scuttle the Padma Bridge project. For nearly 15 years, we were never allowed to attend the former prime minister's press conferences or any of her functions. We were never allowed to cover her foreign trips or ask her questions as the head of the government. Over time, all her ministers, save one or two, started to avoid us, not allowing our reporters to talk to them and speaking against us whenever the occasion permitted. And all this while some 40 national and international businesses were asked not to give us any advertisement, abruptly reducing our revenue by 40 percent. This continued till the July uprising last year.\nWe are proud to say that\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0never buckled, thanks to our staff, our board of directors, and the leadership.\nThe CA's press secretary also laid emphasis on examining not only the past, but also how media covered the events of July-August 2024, now popularly called the Monsoon Revolution. We welcome this decision and thank him for his praise that some media, in spite of severe threats, published prominently the number of students and general people being killed daily.\nWe also need to examine the politicisation of journalist unions. A special focus should be given on the role of the owners of media houses who used their outlets to eulogise the Hasina government for business purposes, get illegal bank loans, get lucrative contracts, retain untaxed profits, and indulge in money laundering. When directed by the owners, working journalists did not have much of a choice. We think the editors should have tried to prevent that\u2014and failing that, they should have resigned.\nAgainst all the laudable things that are being said about the freedom of media and the present opportunity to engage in independent journalism, we are sad to say that some very disturbing signs can still be seen that are posing a new set of threats against free press.\nAs of November 2024, as many as 140 journalists have been accused of murder and cases have been filed against them on the basis of their reporting of the student-led mass uprising. Twenty eight journalists have been charged with crime against humanity. We strongly feel that the interim government's treatment of journalists has been sweeping, denigrating, and devoid of the sensitivity that this profession deserves. At this moment, we have the highest number of \"murder-accused\" journalists in the world. In this situation, how likely is it that the world will believe this government is handling the media fairly? Whatever criticism that this government has so far received from world bodies\u2014Human Rights Watch (HRW), Committee for the Protection of Journalists (CPJ), Reporters without Borders (RSF)\u2014has mostly been for the way journalists are being treated.\nIt has been several months since the cases against journalists were filed. We know of no progress in terms of verification of the accusations. An eight-member committee by the interim government was formed to monitor harassment cases against journalists on October 27. No progress on this account has been reported till now. All this, while the accused journalists are unable to do their regular jobs, take care of their families, and in some cases pay for their children's education. They are also suffering from social humiliation and leading a life of constant fear, lest they be arrested. For any criminal or unethical action, a journalist must face the law as any other citizen. But everyone must be guaranteed the due process under the law, which is their constitutional right.\nWe appeal to the interim government, given all their professed commitment to free and independent media, to take an immediate look into the cases against journalists and bring them to an accepted legal standard.\nMahfuz Anam\u00a0is the editor and publisher of The Daily Star.\n\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries, and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "We welcome the government's decision to take disciplinary action against officials involved in election rigging during the ousted Awami League (AL) regime. According to a report in this daily, 45 former deputy commissioners, now serving as joint secretaries, have been made officers on special duty (OSD), while according to another report, 22 former DCs and a joint secretary have been forced into retirement due to their role in election manipulation. Additionally, the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) will likely be requested to open investigations against around 50 more former DCs.\nThe unethical collaboration of government employees in election engineering is not only a breach of their service terms\u2014their pledge to serve the nation, not the ruling party\u2014but also a violation that, during the controversial national elections of 2014, 2018, and 2024, stripped citizens of their voting and democratic rights. The manipulation of these elections helped sow the seeds of fascism in the country, as it deprived citizens of their ability to hold the government accountable in any meaningful way.\nFor over a decade, Bangladeshis were unable to freely exercise their voting rights to elect representatives who would formulate policies in their best interests. Instead, election rigging rendered people powerless, allowing AL to gradually take complete control of all governance mechanisms\u2014leaving no meaningful opposition even in parliament. As a result, more businessmen-turned-politicians became policymakers, and making self-serving decisions at the expense of national interests became a regular occurrence. Corruption became the norm, while transparency and accountability at every level of governance were eroded, further entrenching authoritarianism. This would not have been possible if national elections had been free and fair; even local elections were not spared from such manipulation.\nWhile some bureaucrats may have been pressured to collaborate with AL in election rigging, many benefited from it. All those involved must be identified, and a thorough investigation should be conducted to determine the extent of their complicity, with penalties imposed accordingly. However, the entire process\u2014from identifying those responsible to delivering justice\u2014must be transparent and adhere to due process.\nWe also urge the government to implement the Election Reform Commission's recommendations to establish checks and balances that will prevent future election manipulation. No political government should ever again have the power or means to deprive people of their voting rights.\n",

        "full_article": "How common is it in our daily life when a teacher or boss sets a deadline, and we all think, \"Oh, I'll start in ten days!\" Suddenly, time shrinks, and it's panic mode: emergency declared, day-and-night sprints commence, and the assignment emerges from chaos.\nNow, in the Gen Z era, the twist is that although we, the \"old-timers,\" allot ten days based on our past snail-like speed, these whiz kids can finish it in a day! Yet, they deliver on day ten\u2014almost as if they are saying, \"We saved our brilliance for the grand finale!\"\nIs procrastination just a well-choreographed dance with time?\nOne memorable remark from Bengali wisdom goes, \"Time flows like a river, never to return.\" This timeless metaphor urges us to seize every moment, reminding us that delaying action only lets precious life slip away.\nGlobal research reveals that 20 percent of adults chronically procrastinate, impacting productivity and well-being. Nearly 95 percent of college students procrastinate, leading to stress and lower grades.\nIn the workplace, procrastination can reduce productivity by 20\u201325 percent, costing billions. This habit is linked to 30\u201350 percent higher stress, anxiety, and depression, making effective planning utterly essential globally.\nIn the whirlwind of life in Bangladesh\u2014from the hectic corridors of Dhaka University to the buzzing offices in Chittagong\u2014procrastination is a familiar, if not constant, companion.\nWe have all planned our work in perfect, neat sequences, only to find that reality takes a humorous detour. Picture this: you plan your assignment with the best intentions, gradually build momentum, and then happily submit the report!\nThe days slip away until the deadline looms like a thunderstorm.\nTim Urban explains this struggle well in his talk. At the heart of this struggle lies a peculiar internal tug-of-war.\nOn one side is the Rational Decision-Maker, the part of you that meticulously maps out plans, envisions a successful future, and insists that work comes first.\nOn the other side is the mischievous Instant Gratification Monkey. This cheeky character lives solely in the present, urging you to indulge in whatever's fun at the moment\u2014be it rewatching cricket highlights, scrolling through endless social media feeds, or catching up on the latest Bangladeshi drama.\nThe comedy of this internal battle is best illustrated by those moments when plans go awry. Imagine preparing for a major project by pacing yourself, only to scramble at the last minute.\nThe panic sets in, and suddenly, the Panic Monster\u2014that wild burst of urgency triggered by an impending deadline\u2014takes charge.\nIt might push you into action, compelling you to pull all-nighters and finish a 100-page assignment in a frenzied 72 hours.\nWhile these last-minute heroics might save the day, they also leave behind a trail of stress, exhaustion, and a lingering sense of regret.\nYet, a more deceptive form of procrastination haunts many of us. Unlike the dramatic rush induced by deadlines, this type creeps into daily life without warning.\nIt's the quiet delay that prevents us from pursuing our long-term dreams\u2014whether launching a business in Sylhet, nurturing personal relationships, or even taking proper care of our health.\nOver time, these unfulfilled ambitions can become a constant companion of guilt and self-doubt.\nSo, what's the remedy? First, it is essential to acknowledge that procrastination is a universal human trait, not a personal failing.\nBreaking tasks into small, manageable goals, creating a \"life calendar\" to visualize precious weeks, and finding a balance between work and leisure can help tame that unruly Monkey.\nUltimately, every Bangladeshi has the power to reclaim control of their time\u2014starting today, not tomorrow.\nIn busy Bangladesh, let's give procrastination a proper kick. We can turn panic into progress with simple planning and a good laugh at our own delays.\nEmbrace the day, chase dreams, and show that cheeky monkey who's really in charge!\n",
