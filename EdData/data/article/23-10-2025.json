On the one hand it wants to welcome technology, capital and know-how from all corners of the world but on the other, it is also trying to insulate itself, feeling insecure about an alleged global conspiracy against it. The deportation of Francesca Orsini, a scholar of Hindi and South Asian literature and professor emerita at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) University of London, from Delhi airport on October 20, 2025 has to be seen in this context. She held a valid five-year e-tourist visa but was blacklisted in March 2025 for violation of visa conditions. Ms. Orsini had allegedly engaged in academic activities during a visit in October 2024, which were, technically, a violation of the terms of her tourist visa. Her influential work, The Hindi Public Sphere 1920-1940: Language and Literature in the Age of Nationalism, has significantly contributed to the understanding of Indian literary and cultural history. She is one among the many foreign scholars who have devoted their lives to researching and writing on various aspects of India. The argument about violations may well be true, but also evident is the arbitrariness in deportation decisions. Foreign business leaders visiting India routinely make political statements praising the government, which can be termed a violation of visa conditions.Those who see themselves as guardians of India\u2019s national security will have to think hard on the cost and benefits of restricting the entry of international scholars into the country. Many people associated with the ideological ecosystem of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party believe that there is an international conspiracy to influence the thinking of Indians. This thought is reflected in policy actions that restrict non-governmental organisations and scholars. There are various forces globally at play at any given point, some favouring India, and some not. While the country must have a strategy to harness the forces that help it and counter those that do not, it cannot do this by fencing itself in. In Ms. Orsini\u2019s case, there is nothing beyond the claim that she violated visa conditions, To begin with, visa conditions should be more welcoming of scholars, scientists and experts. It is also relevant in this context that there are several global leaders in many fields who are of Indian origin but are citizens of another country. A country that feels threatened by authors, scientists and thinkers will have little chance of realising its full potential. Open societies have their vulnerabilities; but trying to fix them by turning into a closed society will stunt progress without necessarily enhancing security.

        "full_article": "Among the successes that India can take reasonable credit for is cultivating a domestic solar power industry. Somewhere in 2017, the per unit cost of solar power fell below that of coal power, spurring new interest among businesses investing in ground-mounted solar projects. In 2024-25, the International Renewable Energy Agency reported that India generated 1,08,494 Gwh (gigawatt-hour) of solar energy, surpassing Japan\u2019s 96,459 Gwh, and making it the third largest producer of solar power behind only China and the United States. India\u2019s capacity to manufacture solar module panels rose from 2 GW (gigawatt) in 2014 to 100 GW in 2025, according to the Ministry of Renewable Energy. This is significant considering that India\u2019s domestically installed solar capacity is about 117 GW as of September. However, the actual manufacturing capacity is an optimistic projection and the effective production capacity currently is about 85 GW.India has stated that as part of its climate commitments, it will source half of its power requirements in 2030 from non-fossil fuel sources. That is about 500 GW of which 250 GW-280 GW is expected to come from solar power. This means that India needs to add about 30 GW annually until 2030. However, India has effectively been able to add only about 17 GW-23 GW annually in the recent past. While in theory, internal production should be sufficient internally, modules made in India are anywhere from 1.5 to 2 times more expensive than those from China, simply because of its much larger capacity, control of the necessary raw material and far superior production lines. India, in its best performance, managed about 4 GW of export of solar modules to the U.S. in 2024 and that too, due to America\u2019s temporary restrictions. Compare that with China\u2019s annual export of around 236 GW in 2024. Therefore, the large manufacturing capacity that will come online in India in the next few years will likely struggle without new markets. In this context, India\u2019s overtures to be a \u2018solar supplier\u2019 to Africa, leveraging the flagship of the International Solar Alliance, is a good move. While India\u2019s PM Kusum scheme (solar power to rural India) and PM Surya Ghar scheme (rooftop solar in urban India) are yet to make substantial gains in terms of domestic adoption, they can serve as models to be pitched in Africa which, due to the lack of sufficient rural power, is able to tap only 4% of its arable land through irrigation, creating an opportunity for solar-powered India pumpsets. Though China still remains the dominant solar supplier in Africa too, India must be able to step in as a credible second player for a shot at the sustainability of its own industry..

But a trade deal looks less unlikely\u00a0\nThe post-Op Sindoor chill between Modi and Trump seems to be yielding before their old warmth. Given Trump\u2019s mercurial nature, it would be a mistake to read too much into one-odd message or remark, but a clear intent to normalise ties between the \u201cnatural partner\u201d nations has become discernible since early Sept when Trump wrote on Truth Social: \u201cI look forward to speaking with my very good friend, Prime Minister Modi, in the upcoming weeks.\u201d This was after he had declared at a presser: \u201cI\u2019ll always be friends with Prime Minister Modi\u2026India and the United States have a special relationship. There\u2019s nothing to worry about. We just have moments on occasion.\u201d And Modi, who had reportedly dodged four of Trump\u2019s calls in July-Aug, responded: \u201cWe will work together to secure a brighter, more prosperous future for both our people.\u201d\nTheir Diwali bonhomie fits into the pattern that has emerged since. On Tuesday, Trump called up Modi to convey Diwali wishes, and in his telling they discussed trade \u2013 \u201cworking on some great deals\u201d \u2013 among other things. The problem with Trump\u2019s telling is that he often claims things without basis, such as his oft-repeated boast about negotiating the India-Pak ceasefire in May. After his Diwali call, Trump has claimed Modi is \u201cnot gonna buy much oil from Russia\u201d. The Indian side has, meanwhile, expressed \u201cheartfelt appreciation\u201d for his call, and Modi on his X handle has wished that India and US will \u201ccontinue to illuminate the world with hope and stand united against terrorism in all its forms\u201d, which is a not-so-subtle hint at Trump\u2019s new friends in Pakistan.\nBefore this, Trump called to wish Modi on his birthday, and later posted on Truth Social: \u201cNarendra: Thank you for your support on ending the War between Russia and Ukraine!\u201d, and Modi, while thanking him, mentioned: \u201cLike you, I am also fully committed to taking the India-US Comprehensive and Global Partnership to new heights.\u201d What\u2019s clear, then, is that Modi and Trump have made up their minds to work together, with different goals. Trump craves glory \u2013 Russia, Gaza \u2013 and Modi is intent on a trade deal and low tariffs, which are necessary to maintain exports to India\u2019s biggest market. The original timeline for the deal was fall of this year, and if it happens now, it will be on time, and timely, because exports and manufacturing can do with a lift.\n\n",

        "full_article": "India\u2019s growing numbers of elderly need a supply of rules-bound professional caregivers. That\u2019s not happening\u00a0\u00a0\nThe import of a Bombay HC verdict, in a case on proper care arrangement for an elderly person, will resonate in homes across the country. HC made two daughters of a 75-year-old man legal guardians as he is incapable of making informed decisions concerning himself or his treatment, given multiple chronic medical and psychiatric conditions. He was uncooperative when it came to psychological testing. Ageing is difficult. In several chronic conditions, especially neurological, and punishing disorders like schizophrenia, and as a side-effect of certain essential medicines, patients suffer perceived persecution by family. Care-giving in such situations can be challenging, affecting a family\u2019s mental well-being too.\nPer a UNFPA study, population of people aged 80+ years will grow at a rate of around 279% between 2022 and 2050. Incidence of Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s etc is rapidly increasing. Millions of elderly may suffer from dementia well before 2050. Are we prepared? No, but not for want of programmes for elderly on paper \u2013 almost 30 central schemes alone across ministries. Implementation is poor, as is awareness among elderly. And trained support staff, as well as legal and commercial rules for this work, is almost totally missing. Elder care treatment can be prohibitively costly; demand for trained care as per patient\u2019s and household\u2019s needs far outstrips supply. Risk of geriatric psychiatric disorders rapidly increases with age. Coupled with trends in longevity, this means more senior citizens will suffer longer years of declining quality of life. It is a terrifying reality.\nAlmost a quarter of the elderly population, 23%, according to UNFPA, suffer two or more chronic conditions. Keep in mind 40-42% of people aged 45+ live with undiagnosed diabetes. A Niti Aayog paper last year noted 78% of elderly live without any pension, one in three senior citizens reported depressive symptoms, 32% had low life satisfaction. UNFPA found almost 19% have no income. There\u2019s no dearth of data/ reports on what needs done. The problem is in doing it.\n\n",

Sometimes this double standard gets so naked that people\u2019s tolerance, or gullibility, is breached.

To be clear, it\u2019s the contrast with how Mahsa Amini\u2019s life was taken for not wearing a hijab that makes the stylish strapless wedding dress in the video jarring.\nOf all the ruling elite\u2019s hypocrisies, the ones inflicted on young persons are the worst. The freedom they confer on their own while pillorying its larger circulation serves a gatekeeping role. If its opportunities don\u2019t get into broader circulation, privilege can keep reproducing seamlessly within the ruling class. Social mobility be damned. In India we have seen politicians decry English-medium education and Western culture while making sure their own heirs attend the choicest of rich countries\u2019 institutions. In America MAGA leadership diverts MAGA grievances with harsh political attacks on the Ivy League, but continues its own family affair with the Harvards, Yales and UPenns uninterrupted.

Every time govts invoke crisis to tell everyone to accept hardship for the greater good, check if there\u2019s new austerity at the top too, and don\u2019t stop asking what caused the crisis.

Political or dictatorial governments resorted to such ploys in order to present a rosy picture of the vital national sectors under their rules, little aware that concocted data took a heavy toll on planning with the critical issues of national life concerning a broad spectrum of human development. So, the need for an independent statistical organisation cannot be overemphasised. A task force formed by the government to this end has come up with a set of recommendations worth considering. It has suggested a new name, Statistics Bangladesh (StatBD) for the BBS. But a change in the name is less important than a radical transformation of the organisation into an independent statutory body. \nThe task force appears to have diagnosed the ailments the BBS suffers from and prescribed how those endemic problems can be overcome. It is in favour of limiting the role of the Statistical and Information Division (SID) to just secretarial and policy coordination. Instead, an apex body to be named as Trust and Transparency Commission (TTCS) will be in charge of the oversight of the statistical body or the national statistical organisation (NSO) headed by a chief statistician (CS). That the TTCS headed by the planning adviser/minister will act as the selection committee for the CS, review and approve annual reports, expenditure audits and budgets looks fine. Additionally, overseeing recruitment rules and policy may enforce transparency but the change in the organogram with the involvement of finance adviser/minister, chair of the pareliamentary standing committee on the planning ministry, four independent experts and the CS as member-secretary and SID secretary as an ex-officio member may complicate matters. The legacy of bureaucratic foot-dragging cannot be ruled out. \nEven the recipe for carrying out 12 core surveys such as the population census, agriculture census, economic census, national income accounting etc., with funds allocated in the national budget avoiding dependence on donors' aid may be contentious because of domestic fund constraint. But if the suggestion could be implemented, it would be good for the country's economic sovereignty to some degree. If a policy on open data and their release, as prescribed by the task force, could be introduced maintaining a public calendar, it would have streamlined the exercise by way of consolidating the NSO's independence. But to do this, first the financial independence of the organisation has to be ensured. \nFreedom or independence guaranteed on charters often remains illusive because of fund constraints and bureaucratic go-slow policies. The suggestion for the planning ministry to play the pivotal role here with the finance ministry's involvement has the potential to overcome the shortage of fund if the bureaucratic tangle does not stand in the way. However, no mantra of enforcing check and balance sought to be a solution to the problems is entertained if the culture of delay ---deliberate or otherwise ---continues to haunt. There is, however, no dispute about the independent space that the national statistical organisation needs to deliver authentic data. Manipulation of facts or ground reality can end up in disastrous results. It is expected that the task force's report would serve as a keynote document for bringing about the changes in the functioning of the NSO.\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "full_article": "\n / EDITORIAL\n   Atiqul Kabir Tuhin   |  \n       October 23, 2025 00:00:00  \nThe Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) has long been facing a crisis of credibility regarding the accuracy and reliability of its data. For various reasons, the public cannot help but take the state-owned agency's data with a grain of salt. The latest blow to the BBS's credibility came when a secretary of the Election Commission (EC) publicly challenged the figure of the country's total population, which, according to the BBS 2022 census, stands at 169.8 million. The EC secretary, however, claimed the actual population of the country is 190 million, asserting that the Commission has relevant data, as it prepared the voter list by visiting every household.\nScepticism, however, extends far beyond the population count. Many observers believe that BBS data concerning the demand and production of various farm products, employment rates, economic growth figures, the rate of inflation and even progress in poverty alleviation have either been exaggerated or far removed from reality. For example, while the BBS data shows a national unemployment rate of around 4.2 per cent, the youth unemployment rate is estimated by independent researchers to be well over 10-12 per cent. Thus, the users find a significant portion of BBS data to be unreliable.\nThere are two major shortcomings plaguing the statistical department: a shortage of skilled personnel and the politicisation of data, as successive governments often seek to project an overly rosy picture of the economy while concealing unpalatable facts. To its credit, the interim government has reportedly been allowing the BBS to operate with relatively greater independence in presenting unblemished data. However, this must not be a one-off occurrence. What will happen when an elected political government returns to power and resumes meddling with data at will?\nUnder the current process - where the BBS requires approval from the Prime Minister's Office, the Planning Minister, or other authorities before releasing data - its autonomy is seriously compromised. Hence, there is a growing call for structural reform of the BBS, granting it absolute autonomy to publish unvarnished facts. Transforming the BBS into a fully independent commission, endowed with executive powers and adequate resources, is therefore essential to strengthening its capacity to produce unbiased, accurate and credible statistics. In an era when policy decisions must be data-driven and evidence-based, ensuring the integrity of data is of paramount importance.\nIn this regard, a government-formed task force put forward numerous important recommendations. Chief among them is the recommendation to transform BBS into an independent statutory body to reduce bureaucratic control by the Statistical and Informatics Division (SID). Currently, the BBS functions merely as a department under the Ministry of Planning, with bureaucrats often appointed to head the body. This structural arrangement inherently creates a conflict of interest, as no statistical agency can maintain the required objectivity if it operates under the direct shadow of political influence and departmental pressure. The task force, therefore, proposed that the SID's role be limited to providing secretarial services only, alongside minimal administrative oversight and policy coordination, granting the statistical body the autonomy that essential for maintaining integrity.\nThe taskforce, led by Dr Hossain Zillur Rahman, has also proposed renaming the BBS as \"Statistics Bangladesh (StatBD).\" Although the proposed name may not sound pleasing or may seem unnecessary, the recommendation to establish a well-designed apex governing mechanism to enhance organisational accountability and elevate the BBS's institutional status is both timely and relevant. The taskforce further suggested creating new positions, including that of a Chief Statistician (CS) with full independence to publish data without government interference. The CS would be a special-grade officer appointed from the open market and supported by an Additional CS (Grade-1) and five Joint CSs (Grade-2) to manage the National Statistical Organisation (NSO).\nWhile the Statistical Act 2013 provides a legal mandate, the task force reported that institutional independence and professional autonomy are hampered by limited control over personnel decisions, dependence on non-professional approval structures, uncertain funding, and an unclear distribution of responsibilities between SID and BBS. To address these issues, the taskforce proposed forming a Trust and Transparency Commission of Statistics (TTCS), with the chief statistician accountable for all NSO activities. To achieve this, the act must be amended to grant BBS full independence in data collection, processing and publication.\nFurthermore, the taskforce emphasised that inadequate budgeting severely undermines the BBS's credibility. To address this, it recommended that 12 key surveys - including the Population Census and the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) - be financed through the revenue budget. This would ensure financial independence and enable the BBS to avoid donor dependency. The report also called for the establishment of a legally mandated publication calendar for major indicators, ensuring equal and timely access for all stakeholders while minimising the risk of politically motivated data manipulation. What the taskforce could also have included in its reform proposal is a provision allowing the BBS to report directly to Parliament rather than to any particular ministry. Implementing such major reforms will significantly enhance data accuracy, transparency and reliability.\nStatistical data are not mere numbers; they serve as a mirror of a nation's socio-economic progress and challenges. Inaccurate or biased data not only misinform citizens but also mislead policymakers. As the country prepares for graduation from the United Nations' Least Developed Country (LDC) category, the quality of the next course of decision-making will largely depend on the accuracy and timeliness of the available data. An independent BBS is, therefore, not just a bureaucratic necessity but a democratic and economic imperative.\naktuhin.fexpress@gmail.com\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The absence of a centralised waste management system leads to most household waste being dumped in open, unused spaces, forming heaps of refuse across neighbourhoods.\nThese unmanaged waste piles and poorly maintained landfills emit methane and other volatile organic compounds during decomposition. Globally, about 18 per cent of domestic waste consists of plastic, which takes between 50 and 500 years to decompose-polyethylene around 50 years and polystyrene over 500 years. Such waste severely contaminates soil, reducing its fertility and quality. In some cases, waste is incinerated, releasing toxic heavy metals and dioxins into the air, worsening pollution and public health risks.\nTo address this, a shift toward sustainable waste management practices is essential. Segregation at the source can help identify recyclables, while organic waste can be converted into compost. Proper sorting of hazardous and non-hazardous materials should also be ensured. Moreover, the government must develop and enforce effective waste management policies, establishing community-based systems for the collection, processing, and disposal of household waste.\nA structured and well-funded waste management framework can not only mitigate environmental degradation but also promote a healthier and safer suburban living environment for millions of Bangladeshis.\nNumaira Loqman\nStudent, Islamic University, Bangladesh\nnumairaloqman@gmail.com\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

On paper, the country has built a strong legal framework to guide justice, governance, and citizens' rights. But in practice, the story is very different. The real challenge lies not in writing laws but in making sure they are applied fairly and consistently.\nOne of the biggest barriers is weak enforcement. Many institutions responsible for upholding the law face political pressure, lack of resources, or internal corruption. When decisions depend on influence instead of integrity, justice becomes selective and people lose trust in the system.\nCorruption remains another deep-rooted problem. From small favours to large-scale misuse of power, these practices make it easier for some to escape accountability while others suffer unfairly. When wrongdoing goes unpunished, the message spreads: breaking the law has no real consequence.\nThe slow pace of justice often wears people down, testing their faith in the system. \nCourt cases can take years, sometimes decades, to resolve. For many, the wait feels endless and justice delayed often becomes justice denied. As a result, people turn to informal or personal ways to settle disputes, further weakening the formal justice system.\nAnother quiet issue is lack of awareness. Many citizens do not fully know their rights or how to use legal channels. This lack of legal literacy gives more space for misuse of power, especially in rural or marginalised areas. When ordinary people don't feel empowered by the law, the rule of law itself loses strength.\nThe result is uneven enforcement strict for some, flexible for others. Laws may be applied rigorously in certain cases to show progress, but ignored in others where influence or politics interfere. Over time, this inconsistency breeds inequality and public frustration.\nBangladesh doesn't need more laws; it needs stronger implementation. \nThat means independent institutions, accountable leadership, and a justice system that is accessible to everyone, not just the powerful. \nThe rule of law must move beyond words in books to actions in real life. Only then can justice truly serve every citizen.\nSangida Jahan Ripa \nStudent\nNorth South University \nsangida.ripa@northsouth.edu\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
