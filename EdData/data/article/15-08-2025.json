This approach has led to some comical errors, such as the Delhi police listing \u201cBangladeshi\u201d as a language \u2014 a massive leap in linguistics. However, in most cases, this has become a tragic and farcical exercise. Several documented instances have shown Indian citizens being pushed across the border into Bangladesh. This has caused significant hardship for the families involved and embarrassment to the government. Some individuals have been repatriated to their families in West Bengal after intervention by the State government or courts. This \u201cpushback\u201d of suspected Bangladeshis is a part of a larger effort to bypass the due process of law, which is often lengthy and rigorous. The rounding up of Bengali speakers has sparked a debate in West Bengal, where the ruling party, the Trinamool Congress, has called it an \u201cattack on Bengali identity\u201d and launched a language movement.The targeting of Bengali migrants has immediate consequences for their livelihoods. Fearing detention and forced relocation to Bangladesh \u2014 a country to which they may have no connection \u2014 many migrant workers from West Bengal have left their jobs. In one particular case, Delhi police detained Bengali speakers who had been granted Indian citizenship under a well-known land exchange treaty with Bangladesh signed by the Narendra Modi government. Bengali is India\u2019s second-largest language by number of speakers. The State of West Bengal is both a source and a destination for migrant workers. The divisions being created over language and identity could easily escalate into conflict and violence. Even for the BJP, this exercise makes little political sense and may be counterproductive ahead of the 2026 Assembly elections in West Bengal. The migrant workers from West Bengal who are being harassed in other States do not belong to a single community. BJP leaders in West Bengal are already facing criticism over the issue and are setting up camps to assist citizens with the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in various constituencies across the State. The issue of Bangladeshi citizens entering and working in India is not new. For decades, people from the neighbouring country have entered India for political and social reasons, including better economic opportunities. The boundaries of India are a creation of colonialism and a violent history of political conflicts. While sovereign borders must be protected, the central government must ensure that law enforcement does not become counterproductive and lead to the harassment of its citizens.

        "full_article": "The Supreme Court of India\u2019s strong censure of Tamil Nadu Governor R.N. Ravi in April seems to have done little to slow down the collision course that many Governors have been on with the respective State governments. Not only did the Court rule against the Governor casting a de-facto veto on 10 Bills relating to universities passed by the State legislature but it also specified timelines for the Governor\u2019s response to Bills. Importantly, it declared infructuous any Presidential intervention based on the Governor\u2019s recommendation. Last week, Mr. Ravi had referred the Kalaignar University Bill to the President instead of giving it his assent. In Kerala, Governor Rajendra Vishwanath Arlekar has kicked off yet another controversy after directing State-run universities to observe a \u2018Partition horrors day\u2019 on August 14, 2025, drawing criticism about possible ideological and communal motives. His predecessor, Arif Mohammed Khan, had also locked horns with the government, sitting on and practically vetoing Bills especially relating to universities. The Court\u2019s line has been de-facto challenged by the President, but through a reference.State-owned universities have become the key battlegrounds in the Governor-State government conflicts. They are among the few institutions over which the Governor has a direct say. As scholars point out, the office of the Governor was a colonial mechanism of control over provinces that may be ruled by Indian parties. That the universities had British Governors as their ceremonial heads, or rather Chancellors, was to bring colonial prestige and ensure their autonomy and importance. India\u2019s early national-level leaders retained the Governor as a central appointee to guard against separatist tendencies. It appears that legislation in many States retained the role of Governors as Chancellors of State-run universities to give them the same colonial veneer and aura. Even a Tamil Nadu Bill that had sought to minimise the Governor\u2019s role in Vice-Chancellor appointments did not seek to remove the Governor as Chancellor of the university. In Kerala and Tamil Nadu, the Governors are central proxies with a hostile political and ideological agenda. Meanwhile, draft UGC regulations seek to divest State governments of their role in the selection of the Vice-Chancellor, vesting all powers in the Chancellor. But the thrust of the National Education Policy 2020 has been towards greater autonomy for educational institutions. Universities are expected to raise funds and be accountable for spending. A university head\u2019s role is expected to be not just academic and administrative but also that of a business manager, cheerleader and fundraiser. It may make sense to have professionals become the ceremonial as well as executive heads of universities, replacing Governors.\r Published - August 15, 2025 12:10 am IST\n                          Read  Comments \n                Copy link  \n                        \n            \n                    Email     \n                                \n                \n                Facebook   \n                        \n            \n                Twitter    \n                        \n            \n                Telegram     \n                        \n            \n                LinkedIn     \n                        \n            \n                WhatsApp\n                \n                        \n            \n                Reddit      \n                        \n            READ LATER\n                    Remove     \n                \n                SEE ALL         \n                PRINT\n            Related Topics\n        \n                        Supreme Court\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Governor\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Tamil Nadu\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        government\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        laws\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        university\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Kerala\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Independence Day\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        history\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        education",

        "full_article": "By OP Singh\nLife is a lot like climbing a mountain. It\u2019s not a race or a competition, and it\u2019s not about finding a shortcut. The absolute joy of life isn\u2019t standing at the summit \u2013 it\u2019s in the climb. It\u2019s in slipping on loose gravel, feeling the burn in your legs, and wondering halfway through if you should turn around. But when you catch your breath at a ridge or find your footing after a stumble, you realise something powerful: the climb isn\u2019t about the mountain, it\u2019s about who you become along the way.\nEach of us has a mountain to climb. It doesn\u2019t need to be Everest or Kilimanjaro. It doesn\u2019t have to impress anyone else. What matters is that the mountain challenges you. And yes, the climb will be messy. The trail will disappear just when you think you\u2019re getting somewhere. The air will get thin. You might even feel like quitting. But that\u2019s the beauty of it, the mountain shapes you with every step.\nEvery great climb starts with a dream \u2013 one so audacious it gives you butterflies. Don\u2019t let its enormity overwhelm you. Focus on taking the next step, then the one after that. Progress isn\u2019t about giant leaps but small, consistent efforts. Moving forward, even a little each day, builds the path to big dreams.\n\nMountains don\u2019t reward the fastest or most competent climber, they reward perseverance. Talent may get you started, but resilience carries you through fatigue, failure, and seemingly impossible moments. You don\u2019t need to be perfect; you need to keep climbing. Your journey is unique; not everyone will understand or agree with it. That\u2019s okay. When the trail disappears, create your path, even if it\u2019s messy. The best routes are discovered through improvisation and authenticity, not by meeting others\u2019 expectations.\nSlips and falls are inevitable, and they hurt. Yet, each stumble teaches something valuable about the terrain, limits, and strength. Mountains don\u2019t demand perfection; they require persistence. Learn from every fall and rise stronger. The mountain doesn\u2019t care who reaches the summit first. It isn\u2019t about trophies or comparisons. The climb is about pushing yourself, growing beyond your comfort zone, and becoming someone who belongs at the summit. True success is transformation, not competition.\nThe best climbers don\u2019t focus solely on themselves. They lend a hand, share tools, and cheer others on. Those you help will often support you, making the climb richer for everyone. When you reach the summit, pause and reflect. Did your climb inspire others? Did you leave the path better for those who follow?\nSuccess isn\u2019t standing alone at the top; it\u2019s in the legacy you leave \u2013 encouragement, improvements, and hope for others to climb higher. Ultimately, the climb makes life beautiful. The summit is fleeting, but the slips, breakthroughs, lessons, and growth endure. These moments shape you into someone worthy of the top.\nIf the mountain feels daunting, don\u2019t let the height scare you. Start small. Take one step at a time. You don\u2019t need to move fast or know the whole path. Just keep climbing. One day, standing at your summit, you\u2019ll look back and realise it wasn\u2019t about the peak. It was about the person you became along the way.\nThe writer is DGP & head, Haryana State Narcotics Control Bureau\n\n",

        "full_article": "Trump delaying tariffs on China while targeting India shows our lack of strategic tech and manufacturing\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe chip war between US and China is back on the table with Washington reportedly working out a deal to take 15% from the sale of Nvidia\u2019s and AMD\u2019s AI chips to China. This effectively makes US govt a business partner to Nvidia and AMD, and comes after Washington allowed resumption of chip sales to China. The latter had been halted by Trump in April as part of his trade tussle with Beijing. However, he was forced to lift the ban after China retaliated with its own ban on rare earth exports to US.\u00a0\u00a0\nBeijing has now sent notices to Chinese companies discouraging the use of Nvidia chips citing security concerns. Parallelly, however, US and China have decided to extend their tariff truce till Nov. This is in stark contrast to Trump\u2019s approach to India, which is now facing the prospect of 50% tariff on its exports to US.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe entire episode holds out two key lessons. First, the tech war is here to stay. Whether it\u2019s US chip sales to China or China trying to undermine tech manufacturing in India as highlighted by its recent pullout of Chinese engineers from Foxconn\u2019s India plants, this is a strategic sector that every country will try to leverage or weaponise. And with the advent of AI, India\u2019s expertise in software and coding is no longer that attractive. Therefore, India must not waver in its determination to master bedrock tech like semiconductor manufacturing and design, as well as AI. Countries like Estonia are integrating AI in their education systems. Plus, the recent spat between Elon Musk and OpenAI boss Sam Altman over listing in Apple\u2019s App Store shows how fiercely companies are competing over AI tech. India must not lag behind.\u00a0\nSecond, Trump\u2019s targeting India with big tariffs because he feels it doesn\u2019t have anything strategic to offer. That\u2019s not the case with China given its manufacturing muscle. Similarly, Taiwan\u2019s cutting-edge semiconductor industry makes it vital to tech supply chains, and therefore, a prime candidate for tariff exemptions. India too needs to cement a crucial spot in global manufacturing by investing heavily in domestic R&D, technical education and AI. It\u2019s work that can\u2019t be delayed.\n\n",

The signing of eight collaborative instruments by the two heads of government signals the prospect of a deeper and more strategic partnership-addressing long-standing issues such as the welfare of Bangladeshi migrant workers in Malaysia, while opening new avenues for economic and diplomatic engagement. The eight instruments include five Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) and three Exchange of Notes covering a wide range of areas: defence cooperation, LNG and petroleum infrastructure, strategic and international studies, collaboration between apex chambers of commerce, higher education, halal food ecosystem development, and training for diplomats. In addition, both sides held substantive discussions on labour migration, the Rohingya crisis, trade, investment, blue economy, and cultural exchanges.\n During a one-to-one meeting with the Malaysian Prime Minister, the Chief Adviser expressed gratitude for Malaysia's recent measures to facilitate the entry of nearly 8,000 stranded Bangladeshi workers through a simplified protocol, the introduction of multiple-entry visas, and the provision allowing workers to return home during emergencies without risking their jobs. Both leaders agreed on the need for transparent and fair recruitment processes to lower migration costs and protect worker welfare.\n On economic matters, the two countries resolved to expedite negotiations for a Bangladesh-Malaysia Free Trade Agreement, strengthen investment cooperation through Special Economic Zones, and operationalise the Malaysia-Bangladesh Joint Business Council. Recognising the current trade imbalance, Bangladesh urged Malaysia to expand market access for products such as medicines, batteries, footwear, ceramics, and jute goods. The Chief Adviser also sought Malaysia's support in developing the halal industry, including the establishment of a Halal Economic Zone near Dhaka, and reiterated Bangladesh's interest in joining the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). The Rohingya crisis featured prominently in the talks. Bangladesh, Malaysia, and other Southeast Asian nations are planning to dispatch a joint peace mission to Myanmar in the coming weeks to advocate for peace and humanitarian assistance for the Rohingya and other affected communities. Bangladesh currently hosts around 1.2 million Rohingya refugees, most of whom fled Myanmar's Rakhine State during the 2017 military crackdown. Since 2023, a further 200,000 have sought refuge in Bangladesh. Malaysia, which shelters over 100,000 Rohingyas, also grapples with trafficking networks exploiting refugees attempting dangerous sea crossings. In an effort to restore global attention to the Rohingya crisis, the United Nations-at Bangladesh's request-will convene a high-level conference on September 30 in New York. A preparatory meeting is scheduled for August 25 in Cox's Bazar, marking the eighth anniversary of the mass influx. Bangladesh has invited Malaysia to participate in both events.\n The prospects for improved Bangladesh-Malaysia relations appear highly promising. While labour migration remains the most visible and immediate concern, the potential for broader economic cooperation-through expanded trade, joint investments, and strategic sectoral collaboration-holds the promise of sustainable, mutually beneficial outcomes for both nations.\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "full_article": "\n / EDITORIAL\n \n       August 15, 2025 00:00:00  \nWhen Nobel laureate and Chief Adviser Dr Muhammad Yunus arrived at Putrajaya on August 12, 2025, it was far from a courtesy call-it was a game-changer in rewriting the world position of Bangladesh. His visit carried the entire weight of the nation's hopes in a time when the world order is undergoing change, being driven by post-pandemic recovery, supply chain restructurings, and rising geopolitical rivalries. For Bangladesh, the challenge is two-fold: how to maintain its high growth trajectory and how to diversify its partners away from old friends.\nThis visit to Malaysia was planned with an articulated and multifaceted aim-to develop new economic horizons, to forge long-term strategic ties, to solidify cultural and educational links, and to provide Bangladesh with a more powerful voice in regional security and humanitarian issues. \nThe welcome at Perdana Putra Complex was full of diplomatic symbolism. The red-carpet reception, the guard of honour by the Royal Ranger Regiment, and the full military salute were not ceremonial niceties; they reflected Malaysia's respect for Bangladesh as a friend that had special geopolitical weight. Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's message underscored Kuala Lumpur's importance placed on Dhaka's role in regional and bilateral cooperation. It is a landmark development in the relationship. The engagement was traditionally transactional-focused-Bangladeshi workforce exports and imports of Malaysian palm oil-for decades. Today, Malaysia is also expressing a desire to engage equally with Bangladesh in fields like security, high-value trade, advanced-level education, and technology. The vision of the welcome also conveyed a message beyond Malaysia, projecting Bangladesh's growing presence in ASEAN and the broader Asia-Pacific community.\nThe visit's most tangible result was the signing of five Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) and three Exchange of Notes. The agreements are a deliberate expansion of the Bangladesh-Malaysia agenda beyond its traditional parameters.\nThe defence cooperation agreement opens the way for joint naval and air training exercises, technology transfers, and officer training courses. Malaysia's rich experience in regional maritime surveillance and anti-piracy patrols of the Strait of Malacca can most advantage Bangladesh as it guards the Bay of Bengal-a burgeoning region of energy shipping lanes and blue economy activities.\nEnergy partnership is also significant. Malaysia's Petronas, with its modern LNG facilities and experience in developing offshore energy, will partner with Bangladesh to modernise terminals, add storage capacity, and even invest in renewable energy projects such as offshore wind and solar farms. Bangladesh wants this because it is seeking to de-risk its high-tariff spot-market LNG imports and cushion its energy prices against global market volatility.\nISIS Malaysia's strategic research MoU with BIISS will give Bangladeshi policy analysts a seat at ASEAN's strategic tables. This offers Dhaka the chance to influence policy discourse on matters of life-and-death importance to Bangladesh's national interests, including regional connectivity, digital trade corridors, adaptation to climate change, and maritime law-fields in which Bangladesh's national interests become increasingly directly involved.\nHalal ecosystem agreement is a gateway to a rapidly growing $5 trillion global market by the year 2030. By synchronizing Malaysia's globally renowned halal certification system, Bangladeshi industries can enter upscale export markets of the Middle East, Europe, and North America, not only for food but also for halal pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, fashion apparel, and tourism services.\nIn the education field, a higher education and diplomatic training agreement is an added-value investment in Bangladesh's human resources. Academic level joint programs, inter-country faculty exchange, and specialized training for diplomats will produce a batch of professionals who can better represent Bangladesh in global circles.\nThe two private sector pacts-between NCCIM and FBCCI, and between MIMOS and BMCCI-establish business-to-business partnership institutional channels. These can fuel joint ventures in high-tech manufacturing, chip fabrication, ICT innovation parks, and agritech sectors, with the potential to diversify the export basket of Bangladesh away from the readymade garment industry.\nMoreover, Yunus's private encounter with Malaysian billionaires was as significant as the diplomatic signing of treaties. \nLabour migration has been the economic lifeblood of Bangladesh-Malaysia ties, as nearly a million Bangladeshi migrants in Malaysia remit billions of dollars annually. The sector, however, has been plagued by chronic issues: illegal recruitment channels, middleman exploitation, underemployment, and weak protection for workers.\nThis journey shifted the focus towards enhancing the quality of the labour relationship. Adviser Asif Nazrul advocated a government-to-government recruitment process focusing on skilled professional engineers, physicians, and ICT professionals, along with traditional semi-skilled roles. This shift would not only boost remittance values but also Bangladesh's reputation as a supplier of high-quality human resources.\nBoth deliberated mechanisms aim to regularise the status of illegal workers, increase social security allowances, and introduce Bangla-language complaint and support services. All of these reforms, if implemented, will increase workers' welfare, reduce exploitation, and enhance the contribution of migration to Bangladesh's economy.\nThis initiative to participate in a regional peace mission to Myanmar alongside Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand reflects Bangladesh's development as a constructive regional actor. The mission will call for a ceasefire and relief for Rohingya refugees-a priority concern for Bangladesh that is sheltering over one million displaced Rohingya in Cox's Bazar.\nMalaysian chairmanship of ASEAN for this mission provides Dhaka with the stage to internationalize the crisis, secure broader humanitarian responsibility-sharing, and exercise diplomatic leverage on Myanmar's military junta. Besides the Rohingya situation, participation in such regional tasks assigns Bangladesh more credibility in peace building and humanitarian diplomacy-the key that can open doors to other multilateral endeavours.\nTwo-way trade, which stood at RM13.35 billion in 2024 (5.1 per cent higher than 2023), may double if the scheme projects are agreed upon. Malaysian contributions to ASEAN can also help Bangladesh become more integrated into Southeast Asian economic corridors and thus qualify to benefit from the world's fastest-growing regional market. Academic and social business collaboration enhances Bangladesh's soft power to project a progressive national image across the globe.\nThe real challenge is to transform signatures into measurable outcomes. All MoUs need to be backed by a shared implementation task force with quarterly report cards. An annual Bangladesh-Malaysia Investment Forum, alternatively between Kuala Lumpur and Dhaka, can sustain business momentum and ensure ongoing stakeholder dialogue.\nYunus's diplomacy is a further expression of his life-long commitment to the principles of social sustainability, inclusion, and innovation-applied at the statecraft level. His Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia keynote, which followed an honorary doctorate in Social Business, confirmed that economic partnerships must be sensitive to social needs while driving growth.\nFinally, this trip was not about ritual photos; it was about the bricks of a new chapter in Bangladesh's rise. With discipline and enforcement of the commitments, Bangladesh was poised, over the next five years, to achieve energy security, make a mark in the precious halal economy, double two-way trade to $6 billion by 2030, transition to a high-skill migration profile, and increase its regional voice in humanitarian and peace diplomacy.\nSibhuiyan@yahoo.com\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The absence of a strong referral system in healthcare is one of such issues, which has created a series of problems affecting patients, doctors, and the overall efficiency of the health sector.\nIn most countries, particularly those with well-organised healthcare systems, have a strong referral mechanism in which patients first consult general practitioners or GPs in their community - be it rural or urban areas. The GPs assess their conditions, offer primary treatment, and refer them to appropriate specialists, if necessary. This referral system ensures that patients receive the right treatment at the right time and reduces unnecessary expenses. Bangladesh should have such a system in place as a former colony of Britain, a good example of a well-organised GP-driven referral system that directs patients to start with primary care, because the foundation of Bangladesh's healthcare system was established during British rule. However, the present scenario in Bangladesh is far away from that system. Patients here usually bypass GPs, heading straight to specialist doctors of their choice due to the absence of the referral system. Most of the patients believe that specialists will solve their problems more effectively, no matter whether their condition actually requires consulting such specialists. This approach leads patients to misjudging their conditions and ending up visiting the wrong type of specialist. For example, someone with a common skin rash may rush to a highly reputed dermatologist without realising that a GP could have diagnosed and treated the issue in a fraction of the time.\nThis approach often causes an unnecessary burden of expenditure on patients, who have to meet a major portion of the medical expenses from their own pocket unlike the citizens of most countries. According to a World Bank report, Bangladesh's out-of-pocket expenditure on health per capita at purchasing power parity was the 8th highest among 45 least developed countries in 2021.\nSpecialist consultations, diagnostic tests, and treatments, which can sometimes be avoided with the guidance of GPs, generally involve higher fees compared to primary care services.\nChoosing specialist doctors first also creates a huge burden of patients on \"celebrity doctors\", who are nationwide recognised for their expertise in particular fields. The excessive concentration of patients on a small group of doctors limits access for those who genuinely need their expertise. These doctors face overwhelming patient queues, making it difficult for them to spare adequate time for each case. Patients have to wait for hours, sometimes days, to secure an appointment, only to find that their issue does not require such specialised care. Such wastage of time sometimes heightens the risk for those encountering life-threatening conditions.\nThe absence of a referral system also leads to an inefficient use of medical resources. Without the system, specialist doctors spend a significant amount of time handling cases that could easily be managed at the primary care level. This inefficiency lowers the quality of care and delays in specialist treatment for serious conditions can have critical consequences.\nThe health scenario in Bangladesh would be changed drastically if the country is able to establish a well-designed referral system. Developing such a system would be hard, but not impossible. The existing network of community clinics and upazila health complexes could serve as the foundation for this system. But for that these facilities would have to be equipped with qualified doctors trained in general practice, along with sufficient medical supplies and diagnostic tools to handle common ailments. Besides, a campaign would also be necessary to make people understand that consulting a GP first is not a compromise in care but a smart, efficient step toward proper treatment.\nrahmansrdk@gmail.com\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Contributing over 25 percent to the country's GDP and employing millions, SMEs are increasingly turning to e-commerce, cloud-based accounting, and mobile payment platforms to improve efficiency.\nIndustry experts note that the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this shift, pushing even traditional businesses to embrace online sales channels. Government initiatives, such as the \"Digital Bangladesh\" vision and access to low-interest loans for tech adoption, have further boosted confidence among entrepreneurs.\nHowever, challenges remain. Many SME owners cite limited digital literacy, cybersecurity risks, and insufficient infrastructure as barriers to full-scale transformation. Analysts suggest that targeted training programs, coupled with improved rural internet connectivity, could unlock the sector's full potential.\nIf these hurdles are addressed, Bangladesh's SMEs could not only enhance productivity but also compete more effectively in regional and global markets. With the right support, the sector's digital journey may well define the next phase of the nation's economic growth.\nMd.
