Barely three weeks later, Mr. Netanyahu, who had vowed to destroy Hamas, found a convenient pretext to resume strikes. He accused Hamas of violating the ceasefire, and claimed that the remains returned by the group were the body parts of a hostage already retrieved. Several hostages are believed to have been buried under the rubble, while Gaza\u2019s officials and Egyptian excavators continue struggling to locate and identify bodies of captives. On Tuesday, Israel said militants fired anti-tank missiles at soldiers in Rafah, southern Gaza, killing one soldier \u2014 Hamas has denied any involvement. Mr. Netanyahu ordered retaliatory strikes, killing 104 Palestinians overnight, including 46 children and 20 women. After the assault, Israel announced that the ceasefire was back in effect \u2014 but what kind of a ceasefire is Israel observing if it has the freedom to carry out devastating attacks on Palestinian civilians?While the ceasefire offered a respite to the Palestinians from daily Israeli bombardments and allowed the release of hostages and Palestinian prisoners, the absence of any credible enforcement mechanism makes it extremely fragile. Israeli troops still control roughly 55% of Gaza\u2019s territory. It would be unrealistic to expect that the Palestinians, who were bombed and displaced repeatedly over 24 months, would quietly accept the Israeli military occupation. Hamas has enforced its control in the rest of Gaza. Within Israel, Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s far-right coalition allies want the war to continue and Gaza ethnically cleansed of Palestinians. Despite the deep mistrust, all sides agreed to the ceasefire largely under U.S. pressure \u2014 Hamas needed a reprieve and Israel wanted its hostages back. The next stage of Mr. Trump\u2019s peace plan is even more controversial as it calls for Hamas\u2019s disarmament, which it has not agreed to. If Mr. Trump is serious about the peace push, he must own his plan and build mechanisms that ensure both sides adhere to their commitments. His boastful talk about peace will mean little if he allows Israel to continue to kill Palestinian civilians with impunity, while claiming that the ceasefire remains in place. For any truce to endure, Israeli troops must withdraw from Gaza and a new Palestinian administration should be in charge of the enclave. What Palestinians in Gaza desperately need is assistance for recovery, resettlement and reconstruction \u2014 not more bombs.

        "full_article": "A new Union Tribal Affairs Ministry policy framework is a reminder that India\u2019s conservation strategy is not a fortress conservation model but one in which protecting the country\u2019s tigers is a social contract. The policy\u2019s foremost virtue is reiteration that people living near or inside forests cannot be relocated until the Forest Rights Act (FRA) 2006 process has been completed, affirming that they are stakeholders, not trespassers. This view has sadly been falling out of favour with a government that is increasingly seeing forests solely for their climate utility and a judiciary keen to settle long-standing disputes. The policy casting relocation as an \u201cexceptional\u201d measure also overturns the 2024 National Tiger Conservation Authority directive to remove villages en masse from tiger reserves. Instead of treating humans and tigers as mutually exclusive, the framework promotes research and pilot projects on sustainable co-habitation that could help redefine tiger conservation through a more socially legitimate, and possibly more resilient model. Its invocation of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act for unlawful evictions and a three-tier system for redress also provide a safety net rarely available to these communities.This said, forest-dependent communities have varied needs: some expect hospitals and schools while others fight to preserve traditional lifestyles. Equally, tigers are sensitive and the reason many conservationists believe human-free core zones are essential to conserve apex predators. A national mission to protect tigers on scientific terms needs to ensure such tracts. Fundamentally, while a national policy protects rights, fine-grained mechanisms sensitive to particular local conditions are crucial for people and tigers to sustainably coexist. Such mechanisms are however beyond the ability of top-level Ministries. The conservation establishment is likely to resist the new policy because it could slow efforts to consolidate tiger habitats and increase the implementation burden, potentially leading to dual policies on the ground. In fact, conservation in India is largely controlled by Forest Departments under the Environment Ministry and States have wide latitude in implementing the FRA. Even in places where local departments wield significant control, forced relocations may continue in States that do not enforce the proposed National Framework for Community-Centred Conservation and Relocation. While existing policy defines compensation criteria and the minimum inviolate area for a sustainable population, their implementation often violates established principles. Just as the fortress model has often been insensitive to people\u2019s rights in practice, exiting it should not mean entering one in which India\u2019s natural riches can be forsworn.

        "full_article": "Trump-Xi Busan truce could be tactical. But a confident China could return to bullying. India should be wary\u00a0\nThe Trump-Xi meeting in Busan, South Korea, appears to have brought the fraying US-China relationship back to management mode. Trump, who seemed more optimistic, said both sides had agreed on almost everything and had reached a trade deal that could be signed soon. Beijing didn\u2019t go so far but admitted that a basic consensus was reached on addressing major concerns.\u00a0\nThe immediate outcome is that US will reduce fentanyl-related tariff on China by 10%, bringing the overall tariff rate on Chinese goods to 47% \u2013 which is below that of India\u2019s rate \u2013 and China will pause rare earth export controls for a year in exchange for US suspending restrictions on Chinese companies from buying American tech, including advanced computer chips. The latter, however, is unlikely to apply to Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell chip, said to be the best for AI.\u00a0\u00a0\nOn the geopolitical front, two interesting points emerge. First, Trump and Xi reportedly agreed to work together to try and halt the Russia-Ukraine war. Second, Trump framed the meeting as a G2 summit. This will please Beijing. For, it has long aspired to be treated as an equal to US, managing global affairs jointly. But after the G2 concept first came into vogue during the Obama administration in late 2000s, the relationship quickly devolved to strategic competition. Plus, the first iteration of G2 also saw China adopt a bullying approach to India, confident in the knowledge that Washington wouldn\u2019t jeopardise its relationship with Beijing. That dynamic could return now, to India\u2019s detriment.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, Trump might have changed his tone on China perhaps because he no longer sees Putin as reliable. Driving a strategic wedge between Moscow and Beijing is a key Washington goal. So, if Putin can\u2019t be co-opted, perhaps Xi can be. But Trump is unpredictable. Moments before meeting Xi he ordered resumption of US nuclear testing in response to advanced weapons testing by China and Russia. This shows that the Busan truce may be more tactical, and fundamental strategic issues remain unresolved. Washington and Beijing, therefore, could just be preparing for their next bout. \n\n",

The term derives from the hunting practice of tying a live pigeon to a stool to attract other birds into a net.\u00a0\nThe Japanese invention gives a new meaning to the term, with the AI-enabled WC providing information from your stool to detect bacterial and other anomalies, to help in the early detection of disease.\u00a0\nUrban legend falsely credits Thomas Crapper, a 19th century English plumber with having invented the first flush-toilet WC, or water closet,\u00a0and whose name is erroneously believed to have given rise to the vulgar word \u2018crap\u2019 for excreta or rubbish, which etymologists have traced to the old French term \u2018crappe\u2019 for chaff or waste matter.\u00a0\nThe first WC was devised in 1596 by Sir John Harrington for his godmother Queen Elizabeth I, though it didn\u2019t come into common usage till the Victorian age.\u00a0\nBut even as what might be called Japan\u2019s poop scoop makes if not media headlines at least commercial bottom lines in more senses than one, it will remain a remote concept in India where despite the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, 11% of the country\u2019s population, out of choice or necessity, still practises open defecation.\u00a0\nAnd if these millions ever get to hear of it, they might well greet the news of the Nippon potty with a sceptical poo-poo. \n\n",

        "full_article": "Maritime growth and governance are finally being addressed seriously and with commitment. It\u2019s a long voyage ahead\nAs the Maritime Leaders Conclave comes to a close, the future of India\u2019s ports ecosystem looks promising, thanks to GOI\u2019s strong investment push and a 360-degree approach to development. This is long overdue \u2013 despite a coastline stretching over 11,000km and about 14,000km of navigable waterways, India underuses its maritime potential compared to road and rail. Currently, just 7% of freight (by tonne-km) moves by sea or inland waterways, while about 65% goes by road and 22% by rail. Contrast that with China, where 34% of freight moves by water, 43% by road, and 17% by rail. Of course, the thing about ports is that it\u2019s not about catching up \u2013 it\u2019s about playing to geography\u2019s strengths. India\u2019s strategic location offers a natural alternative to existing global trade routes increasingly exposed to geopolitical uncertainties.\nA raft of four new legislations passed this year, led by the Indian Ports Act, 2025, aims to modernise port governance, improve legal clarity, enhance transparency and streamline port and shipping operations. However, the Ports Act\u2019s passage without debate has had critics worry that dispute resolution mechanisms may not be enough to attract investors. India\u2019s 12 major and over 200 minor ports handle nearly 95% of the country\u2019s export-import cargo. But the share managed by the mega ports has shrunk, while smaller ports have been moving more goods. Yet the rise of ultra-large container vessels has pushed global shipping toward deeper, more reliable large ports.\nAnother challenge is that 90-95% of India\u2019s cargo is transported by foreign shipping lines, and most containers are imported, an area dominated by China. GOI knows port modernisation and better governance alone won\u2019t automatically boost Indian shipping. Shipowners and builders have very different needs from port and terminal operators, whose competitiveness depends on location, service quality, tariffs, and facilities. For carriers, operational efficiency is what truly matters \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter whether a port is public or private, as long as the turnaround is quick and reliable. As long as foreign carriers dominate India\u2019s trade, the country will have limited influence over key issues such as freight rates, even as its ports become more efficient. GOI has to stay on the ball to ensure growth isn\u2019t caught in\u00a0 incremental measures when giant leaps are needed. \n\n",

This is an opportunity for Noel Tata to create his own legacy\nBy numbers, Tata Group is a big part of the India story. It is India\u2019s largest private sector employer, earns $180bn in revenue, and has a combined market cap of over $300bn. More importantly, the Tata name is proof that the country can produce a world-class, trustworthy brand. So, neither the conglomerate nor the country can afford disruptions at the top; stability and continuity are of vital importance. That Noel Tata has consolidated his grip on Tata Trusts, which controls Tata Sons \u2013 the group\u2019s holding company \u2013 is therefore to be welcomed. Board-level issues should be settled quickly so that the group can get back to focusing on business. Given the multiple external challenges it faces \u2013 such as Trump\u2019s H-1B curbs, which can impact TCS, and tariff shocks \u2013 the last thing it needs is to be distracted by internecine battles.\nThrough the history of large entities, a transition from old to new has not always been smooth. So the tensions within the Tata Group over the last couple of months should not come as a big surprise. Ratan Tata\u2019s campaign for full control three decades ago \u2013 in the face of almost open defiance from the group\u2019s chieftains, who ran their companies as fiefdoms \u2013 took many years. By comparison, the current round of discord within the Tata Trusts board spilled into public view only about a couple of months ago when the Mehli Mistry faction broke with the tradition of unanimity by voting against a Tata Trusts\u2019 nominee director on the Tata Sons board; the events that followed culminated in retaliatory action in the form of a majority vote against the reappointment of Mistry.\nUnder Ratan Tata, the group\u2019s revenues rose from $4bn to $100bn in the first two decades. Now that another Tata appears secure in the saddle, he has an opportunity to create his own legacy at the 157-year-old conglomerate. Both the Tatas and the nation stand to gain.\n\n",

        "full_article": "It is unacceptable that the Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation (BADC), a government agency tasked with advancing the country's agricultural interests, is itself violating key environmental and urban planning laws to build a tissue culture laboratory. Reportedly, it began constructing a four-storey structure in 2023 on 11 acres of the 117-acre Goidartek pond, which plays a vital role in preventing flooding in large parts of Dhaka and is clearly marked as a retention zone in Rajuk's Detailed Area Plan (DAP) 2010. Shockingly, BADC went ahead with the project despite objections from environmentalists and without obtaining clearances from Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (Rajuk) or the Department of Environment (DoE). Building any structure on this land constitutes a violation of the Environment Conservation (Amendment) Act, 2010 and the Building Construction Act, 1952. Yet the building's main structure is nearly complete, with several additional structures and boundary walls under construction. Such disregard for the law by a state institution sets a dangerous precedent.\nAccording to reports, the Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) has repeatedly urged BADC to stop the construction, even offering alternative land for the laboratory at a different location. Despite this, the construction continued. Moreover, after the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (BELA) filed a petition to halt the project, the High Court declared the construction illegal in January last year and ordered BADC to restore the pond within three months. But instead of complying, the BADC secured a stay order from the Supreme Court and carried on with its activities.\nReportedly, Goidartek was first marked as a retention pond in the Structure Plan 1997 of the Dhaka Metropolitan Development Plan (DMDP), which was later included in DAP 2010. It is also listed as a water-regulating pond in DNCC's zoning plan. However, the BADC chairman has claimed that the land in question, covering 68 acres, was acquired for the Department of Agriculture in 1958 and is classified as cultivable land. This conflicting claim must be resolved urgently.\nExperts warn that filling or obstructing the pond will disrupt Dhaka's drainage system, as the Kallyanpur canal and its branches channel stormwater to it before the water flows into the Buriganga River. Any encroachment here will disrupt Dhaka's drainage, worsening waterlogging in Mirpur, Kallyanpur, Agargaon, Mohammadpur, and surrounding areas. We, therefore, urge the government to immediately stop BADC's construction, restore the water retention area to its previous state, and hold to account those responsible for its degradation. Dhaka has already lost most of its natural waterbodies, ponds, and canals due to unplanned urbanisation and encroachment. Those that remain must be protected at all costs if the city is to survive.\n",

While officials claim she died of tuberculosis, animal rights activists and wildlife experts see it as the inevitable result of poor veterinary care, inadequate habitat, and a lack of accountability of the authorities.\n\nAccording to the park's officer-in-charge, several thefts and escapes have occurred in the park in recent years. For instance, two green-winged macaws were stolen in November 2024, three lemurs in March this year, and a nilgai escaped in January, while another fled in 2021. Although the macaws and one lemur were later recovered, these incidents expose the park's poor security. Moreover, the tragic loss of all 13 giraffes\u2013once the park's major attraction\u2013and the deaths of zebras, lions, tigers, and kangaroos over the past few years point to a much deeper problem. While authorities talk about fixing logistical glitches and plans to \"strengthen walls\" and \"install help desks,\" they continue to ignore the core issue: conservation failure. The absence of professional zookeepers, modern health facilities, and scientifically designed enclosures has left veterinarians overburdened and animals vulnerable to disease and neglect.\n\nAnimal welfare advocates argue that the park's vast 3,690 acres of land could have been a model of humane, semi-free wildlife management, but poor planning and lack of professional expertise have turned it into an ambitious project gone wrong. Importing animals without ensuring proper care is not conservation; it is cruelty. Experts point out that such facilities require multidisciplinary management, combining veterinary science, animal behaviour, habitat design, and tourism strategy, which is missing here.\n\nThe death of the last giraffe at the park should serve as a wake-up call. Authorities must investigate the park's operations, address structural flaws, and take decisive action against negligence. Most importantly, they should prioritise the welfare of animals\u2013native and foreign alike, and make conservation the park's core mission. Moreover, rather than importing foreign species that struggle to survive in our environment, the park should focus on the country's abundant native wildlife and prioritise their rehabilitation. The environment adviser's proposal for a joint public-private management model for the park deserves serious consideration to ensure better, more professional oversight.\n",

Labour law reforms, particularly those related to enhancing the scope of trade union activity and collective bargaining, have been long overdue. Despite multiple tripartite dialogues in recent years involving industry owners, labour representatives and the government, very few substantive outcomes materialised. This lack of progress not only frustrated workers but also left major compliance requirements of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) unmet. When the incumbent government initiated a fresh reform process, there was a growing expectation that it would bridge disagreements and bring harmony in employee-employer relations.\nHowever, the newly approved draft appears to have fallen short of such expectations. According to BGMEA leaders, several provisions deviate significantly from the consensus reached during earlier tripartite discussions. One of their key concerns relates to the criteria for forming trade unions. The revised draft replaces percentage-based worker representation with a fixed-number system-allowing at least 20 workers in factories employing 20 to 300 workers to apply for union formation. This reportedly contradicts the tripartite committee's earlier recommendation requiring a minimum of 50 workers to form unions in establishments employing 50 to 500 workers. The draft also permits up to five trade unions within a single establishment, raising fears of union fragmentation and internal conflict.\nAt a press briefing this week, BGMEA leaders urged the government to revisit these provisions. The BGMEA president cautioned that the lowered threshold might pave the way for individuals with no genuine links to the industry-such as jhut traders or house owners-to form unions, potentially destabilising factories and hindering production. Another point of contention is the decision to allow workers to simultaneously participate in both the company-managed provident fund and the national pension scheme, Pragati. The BGMEA contends that this dual arrangement would create administrative complications, raise operational costs and ultimately place additional burdens on factory management. The tripartite committee, by contrast, had recommended that factories be given flexibility to choose a single scheme to avoid duplication and confusion.\nIt has been reported that the tripartite committee discussed 145 separate issues. While the BGMEA agreed to 142 of them, dissenting to only three: the union formation threshold, the definition of workers and the provident fund structure. This raises an important question: how did the agreed-upon recommendations get overlooked in the final version of the draft? If the concerns expressed by the industry are indeed valid, there is a compelling need for the government to reassess the disputed provisions before the law is finalised. For a sector so central to the national economy and to millions of livelihoods, it is crucial that the labour reform process stays rooted in collaboration and consensus. Ultimately, the credibility of the new labour law will depend on its ability to ensure both workers' rights and industrial stability without compromising on either.\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Reportedly, the information ministry essentially run by bureaucrats are once again up to the task of foiling the independence of media stipulated in the draft report submitted to the chief adviser. The reported striking off the independent media commission, the most important issue to guarantee freedom of the Press is nothing short of ambushing the core element of the media reform commission's recommendations. There are other important clauses and sub-clauses the ministry has struck off in order to render the ordinance weak and toothless, leaving the journalist community vulnerable to interference and aggression from both the administration and influential quarters in society. \nAlthough an official of the Ministry of the Information and Broadcasting has claimed, according to a leading Bangla contemporary's report, that a primary draft has been prepared on the basis of the Media Reform Commission's report, it is too early to say that the independent media commission has been dropped. The draft is yet to be finalised and before it is done, it is premature to say that the independent media commission is not under consideration. The official preferring anonymity, true to the bureaucratic stance of diffusing seriousness of critical issues, has only argued for the argument's sake. As long as the civil servants are in control of affairs beyond their jurisdiction, they are unwilling to let go their hold on to such matters. \nThe fact is that the majority of bureaucrats are guided by the conservative and myopic outlooks they inherited from the colonial rule, they will try to oppose any reform to the existing system. It is because their narrow interests are best served if the old system continues. Or, why should the information ministry remove the independent media commission, a pivotal clause, and drop or change several recommendations considered a prerequisite for freedom of the Press? The argument in favour of bringing all forms of media under a unified, independent supervisory body can hardly be rationally challenged. The Press Council has never served the purpose of postulating Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which states that everyone has the right to \"seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers\". \nWhat a weak-kneed Press Council or a broadcast commission cannot deliver, the proposed independent media commission could do if it was mandated to serve neutrally and objectively without government interference. If this fundamental requirement is not recognised, the ministry of information will retain the power to exert restrictive control on journalism of every form at the behest of the political government. Quashing the very idea of an institution free from government control makes all other legal parameters including the protection of journalists' professional neutrality and freedom from violence and abusive legal actions redundant. \nReports have it that the information ministry has acted as a court by scissoring those parts of the proposed legislature as well. Clause 3 of the information ministry reads like this: 'providing security to every journalist and media worker is the responsibility of proper authorities or the government. Two sub-clauses have been deleted here. No one should resort to any activity that may jeopardise a journalist's personal and professional life. Again, another sub-clause recommended by the reform commission stated that the government would take steps to ensure the professional neutrality and independence of journalists. Well, all this may sound like a wishful thinking and lacks the legal structure. But given the reality of the country, accommodation of such points and their promotion prove overriding.\nJournalists are harassed, intimidated and even physically attacked in this part of the world. It is because of such threats, the reform commission included two sub-clauses. One of this seeks to ensure that a working journalist is not deprived of his/her private life, freedom and privacy. Another concerned the legal restriction on forcible entrance to a journalist's residence, search and seizure of property. But these two sub-clauses have been struck off. There are more such clauses and sub-clauses intended to secure security and safety of the journalism professionals that have been changed, replaced or outright omitted. \nWhen the main pillar of the reform commission's legal framework is targeted for erasure, the truncated laws aimed at protecting practitioners of journalism prove too little for the purpose. Sure enough the proposed autonomous media commission could be the right institution to safeguard the interests of journalists. With financial independence guaranteed by way of setting aside a small portion of media revenue, the commission could function independently. Its freedom would have helped create a security orbit all around the profession. \nThe timing is also a factor here. As long as seven months ago did the media reform commission submit its report but the ministry has started working on so late. It smacks of an ulterior motive true to the nature of bungling bureaucracy. Notwithstanding which party forms the government, this central administrative setup gets its overtures ready for the next government in order to be in its good book. The interim government has indisputably failed to deliver because of its overreliance on the bureaucracy. A political government if elected on the strength of popular mandate can dictate terms but to serve their mutual interests they ignore the national well-being. Press freedom is a sine qua non for a nation's growth and maturity. \nnilratanhalder2000@yahoo.com\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Incidents that happen every day here remind us how cheap we consider lives of our own and others. The recent death of a man caused by a falling bearing pad from the metro rail in Dhaka, mirrors this grim reality. Otherwise, how could a multi-billion-dollar infrastructure project have compromised on basic safety requirements, leading to loss of human life? The answer lies deep within our collective attitude towards life. As a society, we have not learned to give life its due value and to treat it as invaluable. We have normalised cruelty, tolerated negligence and accepted unnatural death as an inevitable byproduct of living in this society. Like charity, cruelty too begins at home. It starts in small acts like a person killing a stray animal, a parent punishing a child harshly at home, a teacher beating a student in class, a driver hitting a vehicle or a passerby on the street or a construction worker being ordered to take risks without safety gear. Each of these acts sows the seeds of cruelty in our mind on the one hand and creates acceptance that some lives matter less than others. This is why we accept preventable tragedies as fate. Though we get shocked or express outrage briefly for any such incident, we forget it and our sorrow evaporates shortly. Then we return to our routines and move on. In fact, we have built such a society where tragedy no longer disrupts life.\nLack of accountability is partially responsible for the situation. When a tragedy strikes, investigations are promised, probe bodies are formed, reports are written, but seemingly no lessons are learned from the mishap. Those responsible for any such incident seldom face consequences no matter whether it happened because of negligence, inefficiency or corruption. This impunity contributes to building our national psyche.\nWe follow Western societies for many things, but do not learn from them how to give life value. The value of life stands at the centre of governance and social ethics in Western societies. For instance, the European Union has abolished capital punishment across all its countries. Such a system can only function where people collectively respect life. Could we imagine such a system here in Bangladesh? No, we cannot. In our social reality, if people are given the assurance that manslaughter would not lead to capital punishment, many might take it as permission to kill.\nThe devaluation of life is not simply a legal or policy issue; it is a deep cultural issue. The problem is rooted in how we raise our children, how we behave in public and how we perceive power and responsibility. Reversal of this condition will not happen overnight. It will require conscious effort at every level--- from families to schools, from institutions to the state itself. But we must begin somewhere.\nFamilies must be the first school of empathy. Children who grow up with kindness, respect, and emotional care are less likely to become cruel. Schools must teach not just literacy but humanity, empathy, civic responsibility and respect for others. Religious and community leaders can play a vital role too. Every faith teaches the sanctity of life. However, practices often contradict that teaching. We need religious sermons, campaigns, conversations and media interventions that remind us that protecting life is a moral duty. Institutions must be reformed. Safety audits, building standards, traffic law enforcement, labour protections, etc are necessary for saving lives. Above all, the state must set the tone. When laws are enforced properly, negligence or corruption is punished, and victims receive justice, people begin to understand that life matters.\nWe have not yet learned to give life the value it deserves. But it is not too late. The journey towards that understanding must begin now and everywhere --- in our homes, workplaces, classrooms and our state policies. We must keep in mind that every great social transformation begins with a shift in conscience. If we want to live in a society where negligence no longer kills, where one is no threat to others and where compassion guides conduct, we must first reclaim our sense of humanity.\nrahmansrdk@gmail.com\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

However, relying solely on plain apparel in an evolving global supply chain and increasingly competitive market is a strategy with a clear expiration date. The future success of our RMG sector depends on a deliberate and rapid shift towards high-tech, value-added clothing.\nThe \"technical apparel\" segment spans smart clothing with embedded electronics, high-performance sportswear, medical scrubs, protective industrial attire, and garments with moisture-wicking or temperature-regulating fabrics. This high-margin, technology-driven segment offers a pathway out of the middle-income trap, generating more sophisticated and better-paying jobs for millions of workers.\nAchieving this transformation demands urgent, collective investment, starting with skill development. Producing a simple cotton shirt versus a fire-resistant uniform or medical compression garment requires vastly different skills, from CAD design and advanced weaving to quality control of specialised materials. Government, industry bodies and educational institutions must collaborate to establish world-class training in technical textiles and advanced manufacturing.\nInfrastructure and sustainability gaps must also be addressed. Technical apparel production often involves advanced chemical treatments and synthetic fibres, requiring efficient effluent treatment, renewable power, and stringent environmental standards. Ensuring worker safety and rights is equally critical to maintain global trust in Bangladesh's high-value apparel.\nBangladesh stands at a crossroads. By embracing technology and innovation, the nation can transform its garment industry into a hub of high-value, sustainable, and technologically advanced production-moving from a factory of quantity to a global centre of textile innovation.\nMd.
