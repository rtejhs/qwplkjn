To be sure, this growth rate was the slowest since Q4FY23, except for the previous quarter\u2019s 5.6%. The 6.2% growth rate also suggests that the government\u2019s full-year growth target of 6.5% is virtually unattainable, given global headwinds of tariffs that could lead to imported inflation, amid tepid performance by the manufacturing and services sector domestically. The bulk of Q3FY25 growth has been bolstered by the primary sector, with a value-add of 5.2%, up from 1.8% in the same quarter last year. But growth in the secondary and tertiary sectors that make up manufacturing and services slowed to 4.8% and 7.4% respectively, compared with 12.4% and 8.3% last year. While Chief Economic Adviser V. Anantha Nageswaran acknowledged that a growth rate of 7.6% in the current quarter is ambitious amid global economic uncertainties, his suggestion that this growth is attainable sounds rather optimistic, unless the Maha Kumbh propelled a consumption spike that was able to buttress the current quarter\u2019s growth numbers. India\u2019s manufacturing and services sectors remain vulnerable to global trade uncertainties, such as the U.S.\u2019s 25% import tariff on steel, and an equal percentage proposed on pharmaceuticals. About a third (31%) of India\u2019s pharma exports totalling $8.7 billion were to the U.S. in FY24. News of the proposed tariffs has sent shock waves, with some firms suggesting a pivot to producing in the U.S., which could potentially lead to a trade revenue loss for India.There are bright spots, however. The uptick of 8.3% (2.3%) in government spending and 6.9% (5.7%) growth in private consumption expenditure have been bolstered by a moderation in inflation. The RBI has projected inflation to average 4.8% in FY25, estimating that this would ease further to 4.2% in FY26, indicating a possible alignment with the RBI\u2019s medium-term target of 4%. However, these current estimates have come into question as the National Statistical Office (NSO) indicated that it has attempted a tweaking of its methodology, factoring in \u201cindustry-wise/institution-wise detailed information\u201d but not quite elaborating on what material influence this has had on the quality and quantity of the data collected. The NSO went on to say that the \u2018overall as well as sectoral variations in advanced estimates is attributed to a revision of benchmark estimates and additional or updated data available on various indicators\u2019. The NSO must clarify this revision in methodology to enable a more informed analysis of the data that it provides.

        "full_article": "The dramatic showdown in the White House between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in full view of television cameras, was unprecedented in the history of modern diplomacy. For Mr. Zelenskyy, who was to sign an agreement on minerals and discuss Mr. Trump\u2019s peace plan, the visit was both humiliating and disastrous. Humiliating because Mr. Zelenskyy\u2019s apparent questioning of U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance\u2019s push for diplomacy triggered a spiralling spat, prompting Mr. Trump to say that Ukraine was not winning the war and that Mr. Zelenskyy was being ungrateful to the U.S. It was disastrous because Mr. Trump asked Mr. Zelenskyy to take the deal he was negotiating with the Russians or \u201cwe are out\u201d. This was a threat that the U.S. would stop supplying weapons to Kyiv, which is struggling to slow down an advancing Russia. Mr. Trump\u2019s snub that Mr. Zelenskyy had \u201cdisrespected America in its cherished Oval Office\u201d and that \u201che can come back when he is ready for peace\u201d, marked a breakdown in his relationship with the Ukrainians. This, unless reversed, could prove costly for Ukraine at a time when it needs the support of all its allies.The tragedy of Ukraine is that it became a pawn in the great game between a powerful Russia and the U.S.-dominated North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the bloc Kyiv wanted to join. When Joe Biden was the U.S. President, he promised to support Ukraine \u201cas long as it takes\u201d. The weapons and training that the U.S. and Europe have provided to Ukraine helped it mount an effective resistance. But the problem has been that even with that support, Ukraine does not have a path towards victory. And the return of Mr. Trump, who promised to shut down the war through a reset with Russia, has meant the end of the \u2018as-long-as-it-takes\u2019 policy. Mr. Trump seems determined to make a deal with Russia, while Ukraine wants security guarantees, which Washington is reluctant to provide. This is the main reason for the rift. After the Oval Office spat, Mr. Zelenskyy was welcomed in London by U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who said Europe must \u201cdo heavy lifting\u201d. But he also emphasised that for any European plan to succeed, it \u201cmust have strong U.S. backing\u201d. So it is important for Ukraine and Europe to work with the Trump administration in negotiations with Russia. And if America, which until two months ago was Ukraine\u2019s greatest supporter, abandons Kyiv, it would only hurt its reputation as a global power. The U.S. should make sure that Ukraine\u2019s security concerns are adequately addressed in any final agreement with Russia, and aimed at ending the war and bringing lasting peace in Europe.

        "full_article": "Parties pushing for language conflicts should remember how quickly things can get worse\nThose who don\u2019t learn from history are condemned to repeat it. In the truly troublesome cases, repetition risks worse, it risks disaster. As far as \u2018language wars\u2019 are concerned, these have inflicted very painful wounds on India over the decades. The zest with which different political parties are replaying such conflicts suggests they don\u2019t mind the risk of more fractiousness. They also think it won\u2019t get out of hand. This complacency is built on missing crucial details. Hindi vs south India, is the common framing of the faceoff. But there\u2019s plenty of discord between different south Indian languages that\u2019s being fanned with equal gusto.\nThis weekend, at a book fair hosted by Karnataka\u2019s legislature, there were protests against the sale of Tamil books. This has become the predictable kind of battlecry these days. It was the line that speaker UT Khader took that was unexpected. He said one needs to appreciate other languages, to improve one\u2019s horizon and live in a globalised world. This is so commonsensical. Social media warriors, by contrast, inflame every conversation. From their far and safe screens they, like the politicians, prod extremist, zero-sum positions. As public buses travelling between Karnataka and Maharashtra get caught in jingoist Kannada-Maratha crossfire, neither the safety of the staff nor the needs of the passengers is a priority for the \u2018language warriors\u2019.\nIndia has a history of linguistic animosities that, fanned into fire, conveniently grab oxygen from other disputes. For example, in Assam, the Nellie massacre of 1983, which took over 2000 lives, is one of several occasions when anti-Bengali grievances have spiralled into deadly violence. In US\u2019s Silicon Valley, to walk into a coffee shop is to hear a world of languages, but this doesn\u2019t lead to aggressions in education, work, politics. So when Trump signs an executive order elevating English over all other languages, it doesn\u2019t carry the same menace as changing the status quo here threatens. Think about the many times migrants of different linguistic groups have been forced to flee Bengaluru, whether to bordering Tamil Nadu or far Assam.\nWhat all the war-makers wilfully ignore is that there is an organicity to the way different languages find their equilibrium in our country. Hindi cinema has spread Hindi beyond anything its stoutest sarkari proselytisers have achieved. Bengal\u2019s ridiculous experiment with ending primary school English or Mulayam\u2019s angrezi hatao call or BJP\u2019s frequent thunders against \u2018colonial language\u2019 \u2013 nothing changed or will reduce popular demand for learning English. Let Indians decide how they want to deal with their country\u2019s linguistic diversity. Don\u2019t decide for them.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Trump\u2019s on rampage but Oscars saw little politics. That\u2019s both bad & good\nThere\u2019s Hollywood, and then there\u2019s the theatricality of Oscars Night. Some of it is unscripted, like the streaker in 1974, and Will Smith slapping Chris Rock in 2022. More often, the drama is political. Brando rejecting his 1973 Best Actor award and sending Sacheen Littlefeather to slam the film industry\u2019s treatment of native Americans. Producer Bert Schneider reading out a Viet Cong message on the stage in 1975. Michael Moore shouting, \u201cShame on you, Mr Bush\u201d \u2013 for the Iraq war \u2013 in 2003. Every ceremony between and after these signposts had its political moments, but not 2025. Sunday night was the most apolitical in a long time even though the contending films weren\u2019t bereft of politics. Sex workers, oligarchs, immigrants, Holocaust, trans people, even Gaza \u2013 they covered most bases. Yet, at the outset of a chaotic Trump presidency, Trump was not mentioned even once. Russia once, but obliquely. What changed?\nAmerica, and the nature of the industry.\nSo far, Hollywood has been strongly unionised. Studio bosses know their limits, and actors have been unrestrained. But with the rise of streaming, and tech behemoths like Amazon and Apple increasing their hold on film and TV production, that\u2019s changing. The tech fraternity is always in a regulatory grey zone. Privacy, copyright, AI, monopoly are still unanswered questions. That\u2019s why Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, etc have quickly struck a pro-Trump tune. And as they slip into the role of Hollywood\u2019s paymaster, studios and artistes downstream know they are no longer immune to political arm-twisting. Sadly, silence is golden. But also, it\u2019s kinda ok. Because actors as society\u2019s conscience-keepers was always a forced act. They should focus on performance, and the Academy on picking the best. \u201cBest, not best with an asterisk,\u201d as Elon Musk said after the ceremony.\n\n",

I comply with this request under protest, as I have an extremely busy schedule, and in writing this list, I am taking time away from my other essential duties.\nI am employed full-time as a domestic companion to an adult human male, whose name I cannot be bothered to learn. Last week, I performed the following tasks pursuant to my job:\nMade sure the human was awake at 6am | The human has a tendency to sleep late, thereby missing the best hours for hunting delicious prey. Therefore, each morning this week I awakened the human at 6am sharp, initially by meowing and, if necessary, by employing my claws.\nNapped | To perform my other duties, I must be well-rested. Therefore, on each day this week I took multiple naps. I slept on surfaces such as the couch, the cardboard box, the other cardboard box, and the human\u2019s lap (not, of course, the cat bed).\nScratched the furniture | My claws are in need of regular sharpening so that I can use them for defensive purposes, but the human has not provided me with a fresh scratching post in some months. Therefore I used the aforementioned couch and other pieces of furniture to keep my claws sharp. This also improved the appearance of the furniture.\nAttacked the human | My human is regrettably unaware of his surroundings and unskilled at defending himself. To train my human\u2019s self-preservation skills, I used my claws and fangs to attempt to murder him. In doing so, I also improved his mood by distracting him from his boring tasks.\nNapped | Because I was exhausted after performing the four previous tasks, I was required to take additional naps.\nIn addition to the above, I also provided emotional support to the human by purring and by permitting him to stroke my luxuriant fur. Furthermore, I performed all the above tasks despite being in a constant state of starvation, as the human does not feed me enough.\nYou will appreciate that my services are essential to the proper functioning of this organisation, and that my working time was spent productively. Due to the stress caused by writing this letter, I will now be required to take an additional nap.\nSincerely, Cat.\n\n",

        "full_article": "We are baffled by the position taken by the Ministry of Home Affairs regarding the formation of an independent commission to ensure transparency and accountability in police conduct. According to a report by this daily, the ministry claimed there was no need for such a commission as it already performs this role. Given the police's track records over the past years\u2014especially during Awami League's 15-plus-year rule, and particularly during the July mass uprising\u2014we fail to understand what made the ministry so confident about its own oversight role or capacity.\nThe proposal to establish this independent body was put forth in January by the Police Reform Commission\u2014one of many extensive measures proposed to the interim government to overhaul the police force. These measures also include regulating police use of force against civilians in line with UN peacekeepers' rules of engagement, combating custodial torture, extortion, legal harassment, arbitrary arrests, and enforced disappearances through modern and technologically advanced means, and amending existing police laws. The goal is to make the force pro-people, accountable, and neutral\u2014not to mention freeing it from the undue influence wielded by the government of the day. Such influence never bodes well, as we know from our experience under the previous regime, when the force was blatantly misused to serve its political interests.\nWhy, then, is the ministry opposed to independent oversight when one of the interim administration's core goals is to introduce reforms that eliminate past failures in governance, law enforcement, and justice? Why\u2014when the government claims to be establishing a just, modern system\u2014does the ministry insist on retaining the Police Act, formulated in 1861, or the Code of Criminal Procedure, enacted in 1898? Why is it refusing to acknowledge that drastic\u2014rather than cosmetic\u2014measures are necessary to restore police image and credibility?\nWe fail to see the logic behind the home ministry's position. Most of the reform measures, including the establishment of an independent police commission, were suggested not just by the Police Reform Commission, but also by experts over time and even by the UN. More importantly, the people demand a complete overhaul of the force. So we urge the home ministry to reassess its position and make decisions that align with public interests, which, in this instance, lie in the formation of an independent police commission.\n",

        "full_article": "Here we go again\u2014appeasement. There is a famous photo from 1938 of Neville Chamberlain climbing down the steps from a small plane at a small airport in England, in his long black coat waving a piece of paper. It was his agreement with Hitler, after a brief meeting in Munich, declaring \"peace in our time.\" Hitler agreed not to expand further, while Chamberlain agreed to the consolidation of his existing territorial gains. What is it about Munich? Famous it seems for capitulation and its annual beer festival\u2014the Oktoberfest.\nAround 87 years later, we have just had JD Vance, US vice president, laying the \"philosophical\" groundwork for Trump's concessions to Putin over Ukraine in his address to the Munich Security Conference\u2014an ironic venue. It is always good to seek peace rather than war, but the question is always, at what price and in whose interests? But Vance had even deeper things on his mind\u2014the absence of democracy in Europe, by contrast to the US. His concern was that Europe was asking the US to carry on defending values no longer compatible with its own, because European leaders had moved to the dark side in not listening to their people's preferences, especially about migration (in effect racial purity) and other issues too\u2013 like women's rights and gender identity. In Vance's mind, Europe's biggest threat was internal, from its own leadership failing in effect to keep it white and misogynous.\nBeneath this crude stance by Vance lies how best to understand and apply the term: democracy. Vance quite deliberately associates it with populism, however, constructed and deployed. According to him, it is the populist opinion that European leaders are ignoring but the new leadership in North America, by contrast, is embracing. Do what the people want? Follow the polls (even if approximately three million non-white people had their votes suppressed by red states in the November 2024 US election). Stop trying to thwart the people's basest aspirations, even if those are created by repeated blaming of bogeymen\u2014foreigners of one sort or another.\nThis advocacy of populism occurs within a particular global context that applies strongly to a West losing its \"colonial\" domination of other regions of the world. MAGA arises out of the frustrated awareness of this retreat, a nagging fear that these regions are striking back through sheer population size and related market power, and having the nerve to be catching up technologically. A process is seen by the West as unfair and poached. Japan and other East Asian tigers were early post-war examples of this accusation, then China and latterly India, combining powerful minds and large populations with their rapidly expanding consuming middle classes (more than 300 million in India). This represents a comparative advantage through labour-intensive production enabled by domestic consumption of also exported commodities and through class inequality managed by autocracy and internal othering of minorities no matter how large scale. Instead of understanding these shifts in the global power base, the contemporary form of this retreat in Washington manifests as \"racially pure protectionism,\" bringing jobs back to the American people like it used to be. It does not matter that populations in the West will decline and age without immigration, weakening their comparative economic advantage even further.\nThis is the foundation of MAGA, and that is what Vance seeks to spread across Europe. In this respect, Vance asks, \"Why can't Europe be like America?\" He cannot bear the possibility of an embrace of new globalism in Europe, the fourth industrial revolution, while at home, the US is stranded in short-term isolationism facing the prospect of inflationary under-consumption, i.e. stagflation on a grand scale. Already the warnings are out there, even from Trump himself\u2014ordinary Americans (read: those who voted for Trump last November) will first have to \"endure a period of pain.\"\nThis is the divergence of values and prospects, arising from any optimistic European embrace of new globalism, of which Vance is so scared, Trump and Musk too, of course\u2014the three musketeers. So, they need to fuel the rising autocratic and anti-immigration sentiments in Europe, the ones which rely upon racial othering in particular: the Reform Party in \"England\" (since it does not have much support in the rest of the UK), the AfD in Germany, National Rally in France, Hungary with Viktor Orban, Italy with Giorgia Meloni, Slovakia already, the advance of the right-wing populism in Austria, Sweden and the Netherlands. These are all chasing their version of MAGA, aided by any violent incident now represented as evidence of the global threat to Western supremacy\u2014the Munich car ramming was a timely gift to Vance. Any hint of Islamic militancy is a bonus for the narrative. However, the data in the US and Europe reveal much larger threats from right-wing, xenophobic violence\u2014witness gun crimes and stabbings.\nThere is much to unravel. Vance represents a zero-sum game approach. Protectionism via tariffs is perfect evidence of this. The US needs to draw Europe into its retreatist dilemma for it to be shared more widely in the West. This is partly why the White House fears a rapprochement between the presently centrist UK and allies in the EU, which would help to re-balance continental political sentiment. This is why Musk encourages both the Reform Party in England and the AfD in Germany. They do not want the UK and the EU to be a bloc, acting outside the isolationist retreat formula. The present US leadership is trapped by its populist base, which created it, and they want the same for Europe. So, it has to cling to retreatist populism even though it will drag America down and deny it options to prosper in a revised new global economic order. Another way of putting this is to see America embarking upon a backward-looking mercantilism because its crude notion of democracy allows no other path. For the moment, it has the weapons to bully the vulnerable\u2014but that is a stock of declining value in a world of cyber conflict.\nThe value of that piece of paper waved by Chamberlain did not last long, nor will appeasement and retreatism in the modern era. The emperor in Mar-a-Lago is increasingly without the clothes to satisfy the expectations of his tribal followers. Widespread disillusion will destroy even populist democracy as MANGA (Make America Not Great Again) replaces MAGA. Will the North American continent disintegrate into its competing blue and red states: its outward-looking coastal states (East and West) and its inward-looking stranded interior, increasingly dystopian? Will Europe suffer a similar fate? Will Munich again be seen as a misplaced disaster?\nDr Geof Wood is a development anthropologist and author of several books and numerous journal articles, with a regional focus on South Asia.

        "full_article": "Bangladesh's political landscape has long been defined by division and vengeance. The cycle of retaliation, where one party in power seeks to silence and punish the opposition, has turned politics into a battleground of personal vendettas rather than a platform for national progress. This toxic environment has not only deepened mistrust, but has also hindered the country's democratic development. At a time when political discourse is increasingly being shaped by hostility, BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia's recent speech from London offers a rare and necessary call for unity. Her appeal to move beyond vengeance is not just a political statement\u2014it is a vision for a more stable and democratic Bangladesh.\nKhaleda's six-minute virtual speech from London was notable not just for what she said, but for what she did not say. Despite being under medical treatment and having endured 17 years of political persecution\u2014including imprisonment\u2014she did not utter a single word against Sheikh Hasina. She did not even directly mention the Awami League.\nThe former ruling party and its leaders left no stone unturned in its efforts to weaken her and her party, yet instead of responding with anger or a call for revenge, she appealed to the people with a message of unity. This makes her stand apart from her political adversary, whose rhetoric has often been laced with accusations and hostility towards opponents.\nSince Hasina's government took office in 2009, Khaleda's political life has been marked by a series of humiliations and hardships. She was forcibly evicted from her longtime residence in Dhaka cantonment, an episode that saw her break down in tears at a press conference, only to have her emotional plea dismissed by the Awami League leaders as insincere. The hostility intensified further in 2013, when Khaleda was physically blocked from participating in the BNP's \"March for Democracy\" protest. In an infamous display of political suppression, the government positioned sand-laden trucks outside her residence, ensuring that she would not be able to leave. It was a moment that came to symbolise the state of the country's democracy, one where dissent was not just discouraged, but actively silenced.\nKhaleda's ordeal did not stop at political obstruction. She was later imprisoned on corruption charges under circumstances that many believe were politically motivated, while Hasina, despite facing similar allegations, had all cases against her dismissed upon assuming power. Even from behind bars, Khaleda became a target of ridicule, with Hasina mockingly referring to her as a \"thief\" and repeatedly belittling her political movement. At one point, Hasina even suggested that Khaleda should be \"thrown off\" the newly constructed Padma Bridge, an astonishing remark for a sitting prime minister to make.\nYet, despite all of this, Khaleda Zia chose not to focus on past grievances. She warned that fascist forces and enemies of the country are working to undermine the mass uprising and called upon the BNP activists to unite and reorganise with greater determination. Her message was clear: politics should be done for progress, not retribution.\nIn Bangladesh, power and politics have frequently been used to punish political rivals, who have been treated as enemies rather than opponents. This has resulted in a deeply polarised society where policy debates are sidelined in favour of personal attacks. Khaleda Zia's refusal to engage in this cycle of hostility sets a different precedent\u2014one that prioritises reconciliation over retaliation.\nHistory offers valuable lessons on the importance of unity over vendetta. Nations that have broken free from cycles of political revenge have been able to move forward and rebuild. South Africa's transition from apartheid, Chile's return to democracy after dictatorship, and Germany's post-war reconciliation all demonstrate that progress is possible when leaders choose dialogue over division. Bangladesh, with its own history of resilience, has the same opportunity: to reject the politics of punishment and embrace a future built on democratic principles.\nHowever, unity does not mean forgetting past injustices or allowing wrongdoing to go unpunished. A nation cannot build its future solely by seeking revenge for its past. Accountability must be pursued, but it should not be weaponised for political gain. True democracy thrives when differences are debated, not suppressed, and when justice is served in a manner that strengthens, rather than divides, the nation.\nFor too long, Bangladeshi politics has been defined by who holds power rather than how that power is used to serve the people. Khaleda Zia's call to go beyond vengeance presents an opportunity to reset this dynamic. The real question is whether the country's political leadership\u2014on all sides\u2014is willing to rise to the occasion. This call for unity should not be dismissed as mere rhetoric. It is an essential step towards restoring democracy, fostering stability, and ensuring that governance serves the people. If Bangladesh is to move forward, unity must not just be an idea\u2014it must be a practice.\nMohammad Al-Masum Molla\u00a0is a journalist at The Daily Star.
