        "full_article": "The Supreme Court of India\u2019s pointed observations on Thursday (July 10, 2025) regarding Bihar\u2019s ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls are a crucial course correction for the Election Commission of India (ECI), which it must heed immediately. By urging the ECI to consider including the Aadhaar, the Elector Photo Identity Card, and the ration card among the acceptable documents for identity verification, the Court has acknowledged the critique of the SIR that the 11 documents listed for verification are a restrictive and unnecessary barrier to voter registration. The Court has nudged the ECI toward inclusivity in a way that could help resolve the core issues with the SIR. The Court rightly observed that \u201cthe entire exercise of SIR is about identity only\u201d, that none of the 11 documents currently listed are \u201ctelltale ones for citizenship\u201d, and that they are all meant to prove identity. It also rightly went on to question why Aadhaar, which is \u201cconsidered basic for getting other documents\u201d, is excluded while dependent documents such as caste certificates are accepted, exposing the inconsistency in the ECI\u2019s position. The ECI\u2019s objection to Aadhaar as merely proving residence rather than citizenship reveals a misunderstanding of the practical realities of Bihar, besides legal precedents. For example, data show that while 87% of Bihar\u2019s population have an Aadhaar card, only 45%-50% are matriculates and close to just 2% have passports.The Court\u2019s earlier judgments remain relevant too, having decisively rejected putting the \u201conus of proof of citizenship\u201d on voters already enrolled in previous elections. This precedent contradicts the SIR\u2019s approach of treating every voter as a potential non-citizen unless proven otherwise and which risks significant disenfranchisement of electors despite their having valid identification. While not staying the SIR, the Court also listed the judicial review of the whole process, including its timing and nature, which \u201cgoes to the very roots of our democracy [and] is about the right to vote\u201d. The Court has reminded the ECI that its mandate, under Article 324, is to facilitate democratic participation, and not to create obstacles. There has been enough confusion on the ground following a more liberal reading of the ECI\u2019s SIR rules on document submission and verification by the Chief Electoral Officer, which was overruled by the Chief Election Commissioner. With its suggestion on expanding the list of verifiable documents, the Court has provided the ECI an opportunity to transform the SIR from a dangerously exclusionary exercise \u2014 one that could affect marginalised citizens \u2014 into a genuinely inclusive process.

        "full_article": "On July 9, 2025, a span of a 40-year-old bridge in Vadodara in Gujarat caved in, sending half-a-dozen vehicles into the Mahisagar river below. On Thursday (July 10, 2025), 18 people were confirmed dead. Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel has ordered an investigation into the cause, which locals have alleged to be the long-standing neglect by local authorities. On June 15, 2025, an iron pedestrian bridge over the Indrayani river in Pune district collapsed due to overloading, leaving four dead. In May, a concrete slab being hoisted by a crane at the site of the construction of a bridge over the Kathajodi river in Cuttack fell on workers below, killing three. Similarly, in 2024, the Ghatkopar hoarding collapse in Mumbai resulted in 17 fatalities. And in 2023, there were more accidents \u2014 a girder failure at an under-construction railway bridge in Mizoram left 26 workers dead; a rooftop billboard collapse killed two women in Lucknow; and a pillar collapse at a metro construction site in Bengaluru killed a mother and her toddler. In 2022, the Morbi suspension bridge over the Machchhu river, again in Gujarat, failed, killing more than 140 people. These are only some of the hundreds of incidents involving the catastrophic failure of public infrastructure. They are accompanied by road accidents and deadly fires in crowded areas, both of which regularly claim many lives.Even if they are isolated, they are not entirely accidental: they are symptoms of India\u2019s ageing infrastructure that is being tested, especially in peri-urban areas, as industrial growth and urban populations expand. Facilities such as bridges, roads and hospitals that were designed for some number of users, are progressively giving way under the weight of more. So also are the departments responsible for their upkeep, many of which remain underfunded, understaffed or complacent. While the authorities have ordered investigations into these incidents, few have yielded failure analysis reports into the public domain. Some also prompted audits but they were restricted to infrastructure of the same type. Given the evident ubiquity of the problem, India must modify asset-creating initiatives such as the Urban Infrastructure Development Fund to have additional priorities and adjust the incentives of rehabilitative schemes such as the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation to help regularly maintain ageing urban assets in all centres, with greater frequency in those peopled by 10 lakh or more. Second, while baseline audit frameworks for municipal bridges exist, they must be enforced more uniformly and transparently. Finally, until then, accidents must trigger a probe by a statutory body plus a mandatory audit of all major infrastructure, and States must endeavour to publish the findings at the earliest.\r Published - July 11, 2025 12:10 am IST\n                          Read  Comments \n                Copy link  \n                        \n            \n                    Email     \n                                \n                \n                Facebook   \n                        \n            \n                Twitter    \n                        \n            \n                Telegram     \n                        \n            \n                LinkedIn     \n                        \n            \n                WhatsApp\n                \n                        \n            \n                Reddit      \n                        \n            READ LATER\n                    Remove     \n                \n                SEE ALL         \n                PRINT\n            Related Topics\n        \n                        accident (general)\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Gujarat\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        investigation\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Orissa\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Uttar Pradesh\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        bengaluru\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Karnataka",

You go into a shop to buy something. The shopkeeper hands you your purchase and you say Thank you. You pay for what you bought and the shopkeeper says Thank you.\u00a0\nA person preceding another through a doorway will hold the door open for the person following, an everyday courtesy \u2013 which in India would be as remarkable as the sighting of a UFO \u2013 eliciting a Thank you from the one for whom the door has been held open, which might prompt a reciprocal response of Ta, or Cheers, which are Thank yous in other avatars.\nHowever, the most widely circulated oral coin of the realm is the word Sorry.\u00a0\nThe British are a very apologetic lot, forever vocalising regret for some trivial transgression. You stop a passing stranger on the street and ask the way to a particular place. If the person cannot supply the information, admission of this lack of knowledge will be prefaced with a profession of sorrow for inability to be of assistance.\u00a0\nIn a crowded bus or train, if someone inadvertently jostles you, a minor mishap that you barely register, the occurrence will evoke a salvo of Sorries as though you\u2019ve been the recipient of GBH, Grievous Bodily Harm.\u00a0\nComing from India, where such transactional tokens of politeness are notable by their absence, the visitor might find the British protestations of gratitude and remorse perplexing in their profusion.\u00a0\nSuch perplexity might be compounded by the contrasting lack of any official token of Britain\u2019s regret for Jallianwala Bagh or the man-made Great Bengal Famine, which claimed an estimated three million lives.\u00a0\nPerhaps this reticence on Britain\u2019s part might be in reproof of India\u2019s negligence to say Thank you to the driver who took it for a ride on the bus called the British Raj.\n\n",

The annual yatra, which begins today, will see lakhs pass through Delhi. Pedestrian yatra routes have been mapped that cover most of the capital. Logically, if the order is implemented it could impact a large number of meat-selling establishments. On the curious point made by Delhi culture and tourism minister Kapil Mishra, that most of these establishments are illegal, the question is, if so, why were they allowed to operate till now, and will they reopen after the yatra ends?\nAll of this smells like the controversial UP and Uttarakhand order last year about displaying names of owners of eateries along Kanwar routes. That order had been stayed by Supreme Court. The issue with closing meat shops is that while govt can certainly make arrangements for pilgrims, it goes against the precept that the state must remain neutral when it comes to choices, including dietary choices, of citizens. Food is a deeply personal matter in a diverse country like ours. Religious rituals of one community cannot supersede rights of other communities. Moreover, no community is a monolith and different community members have diverse relationships with faith. Preferences of some \u2018devouts\u2019 cannot be the operative factor in policymaking in a multifaith, secular democracy.\u00a0\nYes, temple towns across the country impose diverse restrictions on food. Both Tirumala in Andhra and Pushkar in Rajasthan strictly ban non-veg food. Alcohol too gets the boot in many places deemed as religious centres. But Delhi is not a centre of pilgrimage. It\u2019s the national capital and home to communities from all across India. And Kanwar yatras have passed through the city for years without meat shops being shut down. Delhi ministers should appreciate this.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Uneven application of document rules across the state risks disenfranchisement. Clarity needed fast\u00a0\nEarlier this week EC clarified that poll officials in Bihar can rely on field inquiry during the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) in Bihar. It said the 11 documents listed were indicative not exhaustive. That has always been the norm for updating electoral rolls. So the initial insistence on birth certificates was out of the institution\u2019s character. The leniency eased some of the anxiety on ground in Bihar, where documentation is rare. Now we have a situation no less worrisome: Uneven application of what documents are kosher \u2013 in some Bihar districts bordering Nepal and Bengal, residents are harried as Aadhaar is not being accepted, although in Patna and Begusarai, BLOs and volunteers have accepted Aadhaar. This is patently unfair. Very many voters \u2013 over 2L applicants queued up in Kishanganj district for residential certificates \u2013 risk being disenfranchised in these districts. Supreme Court, hearing petitions challenging EC\u2019s nationwide exercise, on Thursday urged the commission to consider including ration cards, Aadhaar and voter cards (EPIC) to verify voters. It also asked EC why it was \u201cgetting into the citizenship issue in the special revision\u201d since it was MHA\u2019s domain.\nEC\u2019s tight schedule just ahead of elections has contributed to voter distress. Had the SIR exercise started where no elections are due, both poll officials and ordinary residents would have ample time to verify and rationalise voter rolls. It would be instructive also to know from state election commissions (SEC) and EC the proportion of \u2018bloat\u2019 suspected in various states\u2019 voter rolls \u2013 presumably a tech-savvy Karnataka will fare better than, say, Bihar in updating digitised rolls. Bihar SEC and EC need to recognise that uneven application of rules risks disenfranchising tens of thousands. Take Kishanganj alone: how many of the over 2L residency applications will be processed in time for draft rolls? EC has reassured no names \u2018will be deleted\u2019, but its June 24 circular has also said names will \u2018not be included\u2019 if documents aren\u2019t in place. That is still disenfranchisement.\u00a0\nSupreme Court has held Aadhaar is not proof of citizenship but it is proof of residency. And these are not new voters. Election laws are clear a person not living \u2018at home\u2019 cannot be said to not be an \u2018ordinary resident\u2019. The 18-19 year-olds EC enrols every year move away for higher studies but are still residents of their home constituency. Bihar SEC and EC need to clarify ASAP for all \u2013 especially BLOs and political parties\u2019 booth-level agents \u2013 if \u2018field inquiry\u2019 can include Aadhaar, ration cards and voter cards. If not, the exercise in Patna will have to restart.\n\n",

        "full_article": "\n / EDITORIAL\n \n       July 11, 2025 00:00:00  \nThe Dhaka Mass Transit Company Limited (DMTCL) finds itself in a dilemma over the expansion of the metro rail network, particularly involving the Contract Package (CP) 6 of MRT Line 5 North. Despite notable interest from global firms, the tendering process appears to have been shaped by Japan-specific conditions that have effectively excluded all but a handful of Japanese bidders. This limited competition has culminated in a staggering 162 per cent cost overrun in CP 6, raising concerns about transparency and long-term sustainability.\nAccording to a report in The Financial Express, the lowest bid for CP 6 of the MRT Line 5 North was submitted at over Tk 155 billion-substantially higher than previous estimates and placing the DMTCL in a tight corner. Matters have been made more complicated by the rigid financing rules imposed by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), which limit little room for price negotiation. The DMTCL is currently tasked with developing a 128-kilometre-long MRT network comprising six lines that will span both the north-south and east-west corridors of Dhaka. \nProcurement experts and engineers have flagged concerns, warning that the procurement framework for metro projects is increasingly being monopolised by Japanese firms. The tender documents, they argue, carry systemic limitations that stifle open competition, ultimately raising questions about fairness and technological self-reliance in a flagship infrastructure project. Presently, DMTCL is implementing two JICA-funded metro rail lines-MRT Line 1 and MRT Line 5 North. In the case of CP 6, while 15 firms initially expressed interest during the prequalification phase launched in August 2024, only four-all Japanese-were eventually shortlisted. Of these, just two firms submitted final bids. The lowest bid stood at Tk 155.27 billion, with the second at Tk 164.30 billion. These figures far exceeded the revised cost estimate of Tk 59.51 billion, which itself was an increase from the Tk 39.67 billion approved in the original 2019 Development Project Proposal (DPP). The bids even surpassed the engineering estimate of Tk 61.26 billion prepared in 2025 by the project's Japanese consultant. Officials involved in the bidding process believe this pattern reveals a broader structural issue. The tendering terms, they argue, are skewed in favour of Japanese firms, deterring other capable international companies. The JICA's guidelines which prohibit price negotiation once the lowest bidder is identified, further complicate matters by tying the hands of the DMTCL even when costs surpass rational thresholds. On the other hand, sources associated with the Japanese consultants defend the current model, noting that many donor-funded projects around the world-whether backed by China, India, or others-tend to prioritise firms from the donor country. Japan, they point out, has played a pioneering role in metro rail technology and project execution, which should not be overlooked.\nUnder the circumstances, the issue should not be viewed as merely monopolistic. While donor priorities and technological expertise must be acknowledged, experts should work towards reaching balanced outcomes. There has to be a framework that allows reasonable negotiations for avoiding project deadlock.\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

In a way he has antagonised the rest of the world except perhaps Israel. No American president has ever flaunted his country's superiority so blatantly although its military might and economic strength was unchallenged at some points before. Now that equation has certainly diminished considerably with the rise of China as an economic powerhouse and a strong military force thanks to its planned development of advanced technology. \nApparently, Trump gives the impression that he is more a flamboyant showman than a seasoned diplomat. But there is method in his madness. His stated goal may be 'America First' policy in waging the trade war. But essentially, it is targeted to counter the rising influence of China. This is why the list of 14 countries made of late for imposition of Trump's revised reciprocal tariff includes an overwhelming majority of South-East Asian (SEA) nations. Out of the 14, there are eight such countries which depend heavily on China's supply chain of source materials or spare parts. China has been smart enough to purchase mineral mines one after another in several countries in order to establish some kind of monopoly on a few rare metals essential for production of semiconductor and other sophisticated devices. If Vietnam with which Trump's administration has already clinched a bilateral tariff agreement allowing the country's goods to have access to US market on payment of 20 per cent levies instead of the 46 per cent announced in April last, the number would be nine. \nWell, this much is understood but why Bangladesh, South Africa, Kazakhstan, Tunisia, Serbia and Bosnia & Herzegovina have figured in this list may seem puzzling. The revised tariff imposed on goods exported to the US from Bangladesh is 35 per cent, down from 37 per cent. Significantly, Japan and South Korea, both allies of the US in the region and have long been partner in countering Chinese influence in SEA have not been spared the tariff trouble. In fact, in the revised arrangement, tariff on Japan has gone up from 24 per cent to 25 per cent. South Korea's rate remains as it was at 25 per cent. \nHowever, Cambodia and Laos originally asked to pay 49 per cent and 48 per cent respectively have been imposed hefty rates of 36 per cent and 40 per cent. The drop for Myanmar is from 44 per cent to 40 per cent. Trump's ploy is likely to backfire because China is well prepared for any such trade war. Its economy is strong enough to absorb any shock from trade disruption with the US. If China suffers, so does the US, if not more. Moreover, the Brazil, Russia, India, South Africa (BRICS) group is gaining strength with more nations coming or expressing their willingness to assemble under the umbrella. This is amply demonstrated by the response Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula Da Silva made at the end of the BRICS summit in Rio de Janeiro to the threat issued by Trump of imposing retaliatory tariff on BRICS members. Brazil's president categorically said that the world no longer needs 'an emperor'. Indeed, Trump's latest behaviour is more like an emperor who can make and unmake any nation or people. \nThe rise of BRICS of which India with its increasing leaning towards America is a founding member, has certainly proved to be a headache for Trump. The BRICS may have retracted from introducing its own currency to challenge the greenback but Mr. Lula reaffirmed that such a possibility has not been shelved permanently. \"The world needs to find a way that our trade relations don't have to pass through the dollar\", he insisted at the press briefing after the BRICS summit. When the humanitarian issues such as the daily massacre of the Palestinians including hungry civilians who gather looking for food aid is overlooked in favour of bombing Iran's nuclear facilities by the so-called 'emperor', his place in history's dungeon is predestined. \nHis trade war as a ruse for creating jobs for workers in his country and relocation of factories and industries at home will likely to end in failure. The expansive manufacturing hubs in China not only produce all kinds of machines and tools ---from needles to fighter planes, but also do so on a massive scale and at costs unrivalled by any country. So, China would not be affected much with such an industrial base centrally planned and commanded. The BRICS bloc's original members have a 40 per cent population of the world's total. The market is vast and it will expand further with more nations joining the bandwagon. If China and India can do the balancing act with India maintaining its close relations with Russia and America, the BRICS indeed have everything to gain and nothing to lose.\nIf political strategies follow the economic compulsions, not only China and India but the countries in the Middle East may have a greater stake in the BRICS bloc than their relations with America. Notably, Pakistan, a staunch ally of China has not been given membership of the BRICS. This is evident enough that economy gets the better of military support. Both Chinese and Indian economies are likely to grow at paces until 2050 that others cannot match. So the Asian decades are most likely to dawn curtailing much of America's dominance. Trump may end up doing exactly the opposite of his intended goal.\nnilratanhalder2000@yahoo.com\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Some incidents ignite strikes by healthcare professionals, disrupting services. These incidents reflect service receivers' deep-rooted mistrust in and dissatisfaction with the healthcare system and a deterioration in patient-provider bond - two major barriers to effective functioning of the healthcare system.\nNot only the medical outcome, but also patients' experience in the process of seeking healthcare, particularly the way healthcare providers handle their issues, the unhealthy environment, prescription of unnecessary medicines and the perception of their personal safety contribute to this trust deficit. The experience of patients receiving medical services from posh private healthcare facilities might be an exception to the rule, but those seeking treatment from public or ordinary private hospitals have unpleasant experiences in most of the cases. They feel vulnerable, unheard, and subject to treatment as cases, not as human beings. These feelings foster an atmosphere of fear and suspicion.\nPatient safety below par ultimately results in poor safety of healthcare providers. A study conducted by the Bangladesh Medical Association in 2022 found that nearly 60 per cent doctors experienced verbal or physical threats at some point of their careers. Such a condition affects doctors' decision-making.\nUnexpected deaths - whether actual or perceived - often spark violent reactions and not only families and attendants, but also the media sometimes judge cases as wrong treatment though they lack the expertise or authority to reach such a conclusion. Only a thorough assessment of diagnosis, timely care, medication, etc by a team of experts can determine if the treatment was wrong or not.\nAnother aspect of so-called wrong treatment is that doctors become their primary target of violent reactions though they are not the only group to provide care. Medical mishap might occur due to the fault of any of the sections involved in the treatment process - doctors, nurses, health facility management or drug companies. Several incidents happened in which doctors prescribed correct medicine, but nurses administered wrong ones. Similar names and packaging of different medicines sometimes led to accidents; nurses, responsible for administering drugs, might mistake one medicine for another. Unhygienic environment and low-quality equipment may also result in accidents.\nA lot of things need to be done for ensuring patient safety. Healthcare professionals have to pay due attention to such safety in individual and collective professional capacity. Better communication skills among healthcare providers are critically important and medical curricula should include modules for that. Healthcare system should establish functional complaint-redress mechanisms to make patients and their relatives understand that their concerns will be heard and addressed. Investment in hospital infrastructure and staffing is necessary to overcome overcrowding and resource shortages, which are the leading contributors to medical errors and poor patient experience. Equipping hospitals well and lowering patient loads to a manageable level can deliver better care and reduce dissatisfaction.\nAwareness among patients about the scope and limitations of medical treatment, their rights, and the way of seeking redress is also critical. Public awareness campaigns should be run to create and raise such awareness. Health facilities should also provide clear and accessible information regarding diagnoses, treatment options, and risks involved.\nThe government must ensure legal protection for both patients and healthcare professionals. Special provisions should be made for security in emergency departments, especially in public hospitals. The media should act responsibly, shunning the path of sensational headlines. Clickbait journalism may attract more audience, but it can also inflame public sentiment.\nrahmansrdk@gmail.com\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This improvement reflects a growing confidence among investors, largely supported by regulatory efforts aimed at increasing transparency and safeguarding the interests of small investors.\nA stable stock market is critical to sustainable economic growth. It enables businesses to raise capital, generate employment, and strengthen the overall financial system. It also plays a key role in financial education, especially among the youth, who are beginning to understand the value of long-term planning over short-term gains.\nThe Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (BSEC) deserves credit for its proactive role in this turnaround. By intensifying oversight and encouraging ethical practices, the BSEC has been instrumental in restoring faith in a once-shaken market.\nAs an undergraduate student closely following these developments, I believe this positive trend deserves more public attention. Highlighting the stability of our stock markets can inspire more individuals, especially young people, to engage in responsible investing. If this momentum continues, the stock market could become a powerful engine of inclusive economic growth, benefiting both individual stakeholders and the nation at large.\nMd.
