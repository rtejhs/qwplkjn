        "full_article": "The Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, has raised troubling questions about the conduct of elections based on what transpired in the 2024 Assembly elections in Maharashtra. There are specific issues: the abnormal increase in voters listed in electoral rolls between the general election and Assembly elections, higher turnout numbers after 5 p.m. on voting day, and the Centre amending the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 to restrict access to CCTV footage of the polling process. Mr. Gandhi has also questioned the process of appointing Election Commissioners, with the Union government refusing to implement a Supreme Court judgment in 2023 that recommended having the Chief Justice of India as a part of the selection panel. While political parties, including the BJP and the Congress, have raised complaints about Electronic Voting Machines in the past, many did not stand scrutiny considering the administrative and technological safeguards. The Congress has now focused on the electoral process, raising more fundamental issues that need to be unpacked separately.A preliminary analysis by The Hindu of registered voters in States where the general election and Assembly elections were proximate showed that there were precedents of sharp increases in the electorate before Assembly elections. While the number of new voters added before the Assembly elections was high \u2014 more than 39 lakh voters in just six months following the general election \u2014 similar increases were observed in 2014 as well. The increase of nearly four million voters is a large number and the ECI should proactively release machine-readable data on the rolls for verification. Regarding the allegation that turnout increases were abnormal after 5 p.m, the argument does not hold water. This is based on provisional turnout figures, and Election Commission of India (ECI) data show that there was no significant increase in voting after 5 p.m. in Maharashtra. Provisional turnout figures shared via an app by the ECI are not entirely accurate as these are dependent on the manual entry of numbers during elections and may have discrepancies when compared to the accurate machine count. As final figures via Form 17C data from each booth are released only after a lag, it would be incorrect to rely on provisional turnout figures. However, there is another contention that merits the ECI\u2019s response: retaining CCTV footage and providing parties and their nominees access to it to scrutinise complaints. The process of updating electoral rolls must be more transparent and involve political parties for scrutiny and verification. It is also incumbent upon parties to show alacrity during this process than cry foul after the results are out. Ultimately, the onus lies on the ECI to enhance transparency in the electoral process and, specifically, in providing electoral rolls and retaining CCTV footage for scrutiny.

        "full_article": "The yearning for historical greatness is common among sports fans. Contemporary success and genius notwithstanding, there is often a tendency to hark back to the past and lament that present-day virtuosi are not a patch on the older ones. In tennis, this storyline was expected to unfold in the immediate aftermath of the \u2018Big Three\u2019 era as Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal exited, and Novak Djokovic started displaying his waning powers. It is to Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner\u2019s credit that they have allowed none of this talk to surface. Sunday\u2019s fascinating five-set French Open final was the latest piece of evidence as the Spaniard outlasted the World No. 1 over five hours and 29 minutes of intense, scintillating action. The victory brought Alcaraz his fifth Grand Slam trophy, and the World No. 2 became only the third man after Gustavo Kuerten and Nadal to defend titles at Roland-Garros this millennium. Alcaraz and Sinner have now swept the last six Majors and eight of the previous 11. They are firmly perched at the top of tennis\u2019 current totem pole, and going by the 12th act of their engrossing play in Paris, there is little doubt that it is their rivalry that will prove era-defining for the men\u2019s game.Leading in, it was Sinner who had been more clinical, with the highlight being the ruthless dismantling of 24-time Major winner Djokovic in the semifinal. The 23-year-old had won 29 straight sets at Slams this year, and when he made it 31 by pocketing the first two against Alcaraz, a third straight Major \u2014 fourth overall \u2014 loomed. But Alcaraz, who came in after triumphs in Monte Carlo and Rome, found a higher gear when threatened \u2014 erasing three match points in the fourth set, breaking Sinner when the Italian was serving for the championship and overcoming his own disappointment of failing to serve it out in the fifth stanza to turn the tables fully. Saturday\u2019s women\u2019s final between No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka and No. 2 Coco Gauff was as dramatic and capricious, but alternated between middling and glorious. In the end, it was Gauff who proved steadier, overcoming some treacherous conditions and her erratic opponent in two hours and 38 minutes. Sabalenka, in fact, was the favourite, having also ousted three-time defending champion Iga Swiatek en route. But her power-packed game crumbled in the face of Gauff\u2019s restrained art as the American left her nursing consecutive defeats in Slam finals. For Gauff, 21, it was her second Major, and with a technique that is gradually improving, she is sure to rise further.

        "full_article": "Medics can\u2019t be bullied by ministers. But how medics deal with patients is also a vital part of healthcare\nIt started with a refusal \u2013 correct decision, by the books \u2013 by Goa Medical College\u2019s emergency department to administer a routine B12 injection to a 77-year-old. She got the jab in the orthopaedic ward. It ended with an apology to GMC casualty\u2019s chief from Goa\u2019s health minister, who had suspended the doctor in a brazen public show of arrogance on camera. The video of the public humiliation correctly triggered outrage. The minister was not just badly behaved, he displayed an attribute shared by many politicians: pulling rank at the drop of a hat. In April, a UP minister on-camera wanted a Sonbhadra hospital\u2019s CMO \u201csent to the jungle\u201d because he was not available to \u201cwelcome\u201d the minister on arrival. He too, like his Goa counterpart, believed their high-handedness was \u201cspeaking up for patients\u201d. But they spoke from a point of privilege and ego alone. However, this thread \u2013 that patients need \u201csupport\u201d when facing doctors \u2013 brings us to another reality of Indian hospitals. One that\u2019s barely discussed.\nSome doctors are often less than civil with patients in public hospitals. Dismissive behaviour with patients and nurses is not infrequent, but barely recorded in any survey. Neither is its impact on care outcomes studied \u2013 starting with patients not daring to clear doubts for fear of a dressing-down. As noted by some TOI columnists, there are various surveys of abuse of doctors but none on doctors\u2019 un-bedside manners. The social status of doctors is such that some of them routinely get away with markedly impolite behaviour especially with poor patients. Doctors in govt hospitals are rarely caught on camera \u2013 patients have far bigger problems and challenges than to call out \u2018doctor saab\u2019.\nThis invisibilisation contrasts with the outrage that follows when a doctor is slighted. Medical fraternity speaks as one. That\u2019s a good thing. But dare a patient speak out against a doctor\u2019s behaviour? True, the doctor-patient ratio in public hospitals shows how burdened doctors are. But it\u2019s good to ask whether that\u2019s the complete explanation. Dismissive behaviour by some doctors perhaps comes, in part, from a sense of privilege. That many in govt hospitals are overworked doesn\u2019t help. The Goa case isn\u2019t one of a kind. Similar miscommunication \u2013 where to go for what kind of medical care \u2013 plays out daily pan-India. Countries like Australia and UK study doctors\u2019 behaviour towards patients in public health systems. Perhaps, that\u2019s something India should consider.\n\n",

AT was one of the main protagonists in the terrible ethnic strife in Manipur. It had become a law unto itself under the garb of protecting the state\u2019s territorial integrity. Therefore, defanging this group as well as others spread across both Meitei and Kuki communities \u2013 these outfits had armed themselves to the teeth \u2013 was a must first step in restoring law and order in the state. Separately, army and central forces have carried out operations across Manipur\u2019s hill and valley districts, arresting 23 members of different extremist outfits and recovering 40 types of arms, grenades and ammunition.\nThis process should have started long ago \u2013 under the previous Biren Singh administration. Nonetheless, it\u2019s welcome that authorities have belatedly realised that you can\u2019t begin the normalisation process without disbanding vigilante groups and militant outfits. Kuki and Meitei gangs had raided the armoury of security forces in the state and stolen a tonne of weapons. The guns had to be recovered. Second, trust has to be restored in the state. There\u2019s now total separation between Kuki and Meitei communities. Authorities not only have to impose their writ on the situation but also be seen to be even-handed in ensuring justice.\nTowards this end, reforming Manipur police, which was seen by many to have behaved in a partisan manner during the strife, is a must. With Manipur under central rule, it\u2019s the best time to do this. Third, Manipur\u2019s case shows the dangers of extreme political pandering to parochial interests and making heroes out of thugs. This undermines the authority of the state itself. Given Northeast\u2019s myriad ethnic fault lines, this must be avoided at all costs. Let Manipur be a lesson.\n\n",

A bromance between megalomaniacs was never built to last. As a recovering Bollywood addict, I can\u2019t help but think of Saudagar (1991). Like the film\u2019s titans \u2013 Veeru Singh (Dilip Kumar) and Rajeshwar Singh (Raaj Kumar) \u2013 Trump and Musk have transformed from best friends to blood enemies.\nRemember when they danced through metaphorical meadows plotting to dismantle old empires, singing \u2018Is jangal main hum do sher, chal ghar jaldi crypto beche pher?\u2019 \u2013 Kings of the jungle cooking crypto gravy. Musk once declared he loved Trump \u2018as much as a straight man can love a man\u2019. Trump gave him magical powers beyond any law.\nThen came the schemers. Chuniya (played by JD Vance \u2013 sorry, Amrish Puri) and Baliram (played by Steve Bannon \u2013 sorry again, Gulshan Grover) set fire to the friendship. Suddenly accusations fly. Veeru hints at Epstein files, Rajeshwar threatens federal contracts.\nSomewhere, Dilip Kumar delivers the killer line: \u2018Hum tumhe marenge aur zaroor marenge, lekin woh kanoon bhi humara hoga, policy bhi humari hogi, aur waqt bhi humara hoga\u2019 \u2013 We will get you, law is ours, policy is ours, time will be ours.

Musk now hints at bankrolling Trump\u2019s opposition, declaring: \u2018Jab Musk dosti nibhata hai, toh Starlink free kar deta hai. Aur jab dushmani karta hai, toh blue checkmarks chheen leta hai\u2019 \u2013 In friendship he gave free Starlink, in feud he will take away the blue tick.\nTrump\u2019s flex isn\u2019t far behind. \u2018Yeh Thakur Trump, itihaas batata naheen, executive order likhta hai\u2019 \u2013 Forget history, Thakur writes executive orders.\nWill they reconcile in the third act?

All I know is I\u2019m grabbing popcorn for this battle royale. As they said in Saudagar, \u2018There is no worse enemy than a man who was once a friend.\u2019\n\n",

All the complexities of that EM Forster novel about that cave are nothing in comparison to how it continues to send the odd traveller our way. That one Odissi dancer in one Michael Jackson video is never to be forgotten. More current examples of course result in convulsions of joy. Wes Anderson to Coldplay, we scan any India-ish creation with a Sherlock magnifying glass. Did you spot Jodhpur\u2019s Mehrangarh fort or this spice bazaar or jhumka gali or that Varanasi ghat or Worli gaon? Ed Sheeran\u2019s new song Sapphire has also sent the socials on this look, don\u2019t miss, hunt.\u00a0\nAs a solidly underperforming tourist destination, India can really do with this kind of free advertising. It\u2019s one thing to be totally overshadowed by France, quite another by petite Dubai with nary a world heritage site. Even domestic tourists have begun switching their Goa bookings to Hanoi, Phuket, Bali and Siem Reap. Hence any global song, book, movie pitching Destination India sparking a national amour propre is logical. But supposing tourists far and near do hark the invite and do hoof over, it still may not, sadly, make for a fairy tale.\nAs Abhijit Banerjee has written in TOI, we may be a very big country, but most tourists don\u2019t seem to know that. Crowds gravitate to the same historical ports of call, the same hill stations, the same beaches. For the most part, authorities don\u2019t even try to moderate the overcrowding, whether it means pollution turning ancient marble to grey or stacked monstrosities destabilising Himalayan mountains, which means tourists having a poor to dangerous experience. Full circle then, the tourist will curse the song, book, movie that made the nightmare look like a dream.\n\n",
