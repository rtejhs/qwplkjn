The driver of a gravel-laden truck apparently swerved to avoid a pothole and rammed into a bus. There were no dividers, no streetlights and no signages on that stretch of National Highway 163. India\u2019s roads are a major public hazard. Pedestrians, bus riders and two-wheeler motorists constitute the majority of the over 400 people who die on India\u2019s roads on average, the equivalent to a full transcontinental flight going down. Flight disasters invite scrutiny, multi-agency probes and quick remedial actions but road accident deaths that mostly involve poorer folk trigger perfunctory probes and glacial change in rules, if any. Government documents identify human error as the most common cause but deeper reasons \u2014 vehicular and infrastructural \u2014 are unaddressed.In India, the road test for getting a driving licence examines whether the person is able to handle a vehicle of certain specification, largely a skill test, rather than one of his knowledge and execution of safe driving practices. No safety training is mandated. Most accidents are collisions from the back \u2014 whereas exemplar driving tests in other countries filter out tailgating tendencies and arbitrary lane changing. The system of certifying and monitoring drivers and vehicles is broken and corrupt. For nearly all Indians, navigating RTOs is unpleasant. The SaveLIFE Foundation advocates License Seva Kendras \u2014 on the lines of Passport Seva Kendras \u2014 so that they are transparent, digitised, and ensure good driver skills and safety awareness. One in five accidents are head-on collisions, which have happened even on four-lane highways, indicating wrong-side driving and the state of road dividers. In general, national highways need to adhere to Indian Roads Congress guidelines but States have made no mandates as required by the Motor Vehicles Act. There are potholes, dangerous curves, drainage systems, bridge parapets and concrete objects, but no crash barriers or energy absorbers. Collision-risk warning devices are relatively inexpensive and can be mandated on commercial vehicles. Better pedestrian infrastructure alone can prevent many fatalities. In Hyderabad, a community health-care centre was available for immediate treatment and a government hospital was not far away. But that is often not the case elsewhere. In States such as Bihar, fatality rates are double because of inadequate trauma care infrastructure. An overhaul of the road transport system is an urgent requirement in India.

        "full_article": "Democrats have swept the first major election in the U.S. during the second term of President Donald Trump, indicating a degree of frustration with the ongoing federal government shutdown but also signalling a broader barometric downturn in the approval ratings of his administration\u2019s policies. In a historic first, Zohran Mamdani, a Uganda-born, Muslim Democratic Socialist New York State Representative, scored a decisive victory over former Governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa, garnering over 1 million votes \u2014 50.4% of the total polled \u2014 to secure the post of Mayor of New York. Similarly, Democrats Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill won gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, respectively, making them the first female Governor and Democratic female Governor of their States. Additionally, Indian American Democrat Ghazala Hashmi is projected to become Virginia\u2019s next Lieutenant Governor and is on track to become the first Muslim woman elected statewide. In California, voters approved Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s campaign to redraw the State\u2019s congressional map in a manner that would help the party secure five additional seats in the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2026 midterm elections. Mr. Trump has blamed the Republican setback on the fact that he was not on the ballots and on the government shutdown, which he has repeatedly faulted Democrats for. However, what is now officially the longest federal government closure raises questions about his ability to bring lawmakers together to strike a deal in Congress for the betterment of the American people.While each of these results offers a snapshot of voter preferences within limited geographies, it also serves as a broader referendum on the Trump administration\u2019s policies, especially regarding questions of the economy, jobs and cost of living. Mr. Mamdani ran on a platform focused on issues close to the heart of the ordinary American \u2014 affordable housing, broader offerings for childcare, greater support for immigrant communities, and free public transport. Mr. Trump responded to his campaign by vowing to slash federal funding if Mr. Mamdani prevailed as Mayor. After his victory, Mr. Mamdani hit out at the involvement of Mr. Trump\u2019s family in the federal government. Indeed, Mr. Trump\u2019s approval rating has dropped to its second-term low, with voters suggesting that affordability was their main concern. The question is whether he will now double down on the MAGA agenda, for example by accelerating immigration raids and deportations despite resistance by States, or by pressing on with the global tariff war despite costs faced by U.S. importers. Whichever path he chooses, the Democrats have put the White House on notice, and 2026 will be a further indicator of voter mood in this context.

        "full_article": "Our docs, nurses are in demand globally. Why can\u2019t we fix med infra here & also become top med tourism spot?\nIt\u2019s unsurprising yet heartening to see that India\u2019s doctors and nurses are the largest group of migrant health workers in OECD member countries. In 2020-2021, 75k doctors moved to practise in other countries as did 1.2L nurses, per data released in the International Migration Outlook 2025 report. Two points.\n* First, it confirms trends since the turn of the century, and globalisation, that migration of skilled workforce is a mainstay for developed economies to address in the most obvious way the challenges of an ageing population and growing demand for healthcare. To that end, about a quarter of doctors in service in OECD nations are migrants.\n* Second, protectionist anti-migration policies are not in the self-interest of countries. Nations recognise this, and are tailoring policy to recruit healthcare workers from countries like India.\nThe OECD report points to a Belgian project that recruits and trains Indian nurses for the Flemish healthcare system, especially geriatric care. The two-year course\u2019s initial months include training in Kerala where Dutch is also taught. Such initiatives are welcome as are govt-to-govt endeavours such as recruitment agreements with England and Ireland. Over half of Ireland\u2019s nursing workforce in 2023 was trained abroad, the country is home to a robust Indian nurses\u2019 diaspora.\nWhen this is the reality \u2013 a high global demand for Indian doctors and nurses \u2013 why is the domestic outlook so gloomy? Clearly what is taught in govt medical colleges as well as private ones not focused on profiteering alone (high capitation fees, sham merit, ghost faculty, poor infra) is holding Indians in good stead. The OECD report makes it all the more a priority that govt fix the medical colleges ecosystem \u2013 decentralising the all-India entrance exam NEET that over 2.4mn sat for last year, is just the starting point. Take the registration of doctors. Months ago, NMC reported under 1.5L doctors registered in Tamil Nadu, while the state council registered over 2L. For Delhi, NMC had fewer than 31.5k docs but the Delhi council data for 2020 had over 72,600. There are no answers to where 40k docs disappeared. Add to that the statewise skew in numbers of doctors and the massive urban-rural divide in infra and staff.\nIn allowing these problems to fester and at best attempting band-aid solutions, India is underutilising its potential as a top healthcare destination. Ranked 10th globally, India\u2019s medical tourism market is projected to reach $58bn by 2035 at CAGR of 12.3%. Over 6.4L medical tourist visas were issued in 2024. Yet, fragmented care, growing distrust in private hospitals for overcharging and unnecessary procedures, and poor follow-up are marring India\u2019s many advantages.\n\n",

But arms lobby wins in nuclear race\u00a0\nMad mathematics \u2013 that\u2019s what nuke competition is. Nuclear armed countries have enough warheads to destroy the world many times over. But most want more. And it\u2019s no surprise that Trump has ordered resumption of nuke testing. He claims Russia, China and North Korea are doing it. There\u2019s no proof Moscow and Beijing are mushroom-clouding again. Yes, Kim Jong Un is. But he runs a rogue regime. Trump\u2019s real motivation is mad math. Putin is expanding his nuclear weapons delivery systems. Xi wants 1,000 nukes by 2030. But Trump has multiple delivery options too and he can feel damn macho by asking generals to tell him about America\u2019s 5,000 nukes. So, what\u2019s bugging him? Answer: nuke geopolitics is crazy.\nIsrael has nukes but doesn\u2019t deny or confirm it. America lets it be. But Israel\u2019s adversaries think of going nuclear. Other nuke-seeking nations argue that nukes will make them safer \u2013 they point to Libya, which gave up nuke ambitions and is in chaos, to Ukraine, which gave up nukes and got invaded by Putin. Even a child knows a nuclear war has no winner. But apparently, govts have a hard time understanding this.\nThe nuclear arms race however has one clear winner \u2013 the arms lobby. Backward linkages of nuclear testing directly benefit arms manufacturers. They are in clover anyway, given the number of conflicts going on in the world. Look closely, there\u2019s a pattern. Sow chaos, supply weapons to conflicting sides, which in turn creates more chaos and finally forces warring parties to consider nukes. Globally, the military industrial complex is getting fat on a market worth approx $2.5tn annually. But it wants more. The likes of Trump, who btw wants the Nobel Peace Prize, are happy to feed that greed. And the math gets madder.\n\n",

        "full_article": "At a recent roundtable on police reforms organised by\u00a0Prothom Alo, all participants agreed that independence of the police force is crucial for ensuring professionalism, accountability, and public confidence in the force. The speakers, including policymakers, senior police officials, rights activists, academics, and political leaders, unequivocally stressed that meaningful transformation will be possible if the scope for undue political and bureaucratic control is eliminated. From the discussion, one thing is clear: only an independent police commission with real and accountable authority can ensure a sustainable reform.\nFor decades, our police force has been frequently plagued by impunity, politicisation, and public mistrust. During the 15 years of Awami League rule, the force became an instrument of political oppression, severely eroding its credibility. The fragile relationship between the police and the citizens was starkly exposed during the July uprising. After the fall of the regime, the interim government formed a Police Reform Commission that submitted a report in January this year, outlining extensive measures to restore integrity and accountability in the force. Among them, the commission proposed the creation of an independent police commission. It recommended that use of force against civilians be a last resort\u2014always precise, proportional, and appropriate\u2014following the self-defence-only rules applied to UN peacekeepers, which Bangladeshi police already follow abroad. It also urged the government to prevent custodial torture, extortion, arbitrary arrests, and enforced disappearances.\nIn early September, the interim government directed the law ministry to draft laws to establish two separate commissions within the police to ensure accountability and enable internal investigations free from external interference. It is encouraging to learn that the amended Code of Criminal Procedure includes key provisions to strengthen accountability in arrest and remand procedures. However, true reform will remain beyond reach if the home ministry retains control over postings, promotions, and enforcement of the commission's recommendations. Bureaucratic interference has long undermined professionalism in the force, which must end.\nExperts also believe that an independent commission could free the police from decades of manipulation and abuse. It would ensure that recruitment and promotions are based on merit, investigations are guided by evidence rather than orders, and misconduct is addressed transparently. Such a body would protect human rights, uphold due process, and help rebuild public trust. However, the government must act with urgency to implement the reforms, as enough times have already passed. A truly independent commission, free from ministerial or partisan grip, is the only way to rebuild the police as a humane, service-oriented institution.\n",

Of the rest, 22.75 face extreme food insecurity and 44.57 per cent people enjoy marginal food security which otherwise translates into vulnerability of food availability. Their fragile food availability can deteriorate at anytime. So the myth of near self-sufficiency in food gets busted by the latest survey conducted by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) which unfortunately was once credited to have painted the rosy picture based on its distorted, flawed and what-the-doctor-ordered data base. Since food security is a political and human rights issue, no government feels comfortable with any exposition of such a grim reality. The autocratic and even elected party governments were known to have instructed the statistical body to manipulate data in order to reflect an impressive achievement.\nFood availability can be categorised, according to globally recognised metrics, into healthy diet and improper or inadequately nutritious diets. The report carried in this paper on Tuesday last does not present these aspects of food. Did the survey not deal with the population's access to quality food? It is a vital issue in measuring the level of food security. The global picture of food security is not at all reassuring. As many as 2.3 billion people on this planet faced moderate to severe food insecurity in 2024. According to different metric, 673 million suffered hunger in the same year. But when it concerns healthy diet, 2.6 billion had no access to such wholesome diets. Overall, one in four people faces food insecurity globally. In Bangladesh 73 per cent people could not afford a healthy diet in 2022, according to an estimate. In 2021, though, the percentage of such people was 66. In 2025 the percentage of such people may be even higher. \nAfter more than a half century of independence, the socio-economic picture looks terribly uninspiring. There is no denial that the country has flourished in terms of infrastructure development, industrial output and expansion of commerce. The country's gross domestic product (GDP) and per capita income have witnessed from moderate to phenomenal increase. Yet something vital is missing and that is the uneven distribution of wealth. While the number of millionaires has soared, the deprivation of segments lying at the bottom of society has also been alarming. Disparities and discriminations have yawned because of the oligarchic system favouring the educated and the privileged. \nClearly exposed here is the systemic fault line of social and economic policies and practices. Following the July-August uprising, hopes were raised to bury the discriminatory system and replace it with equitable system of social justice. But such hopes now look like a distant dream. The interim government's elitist stance on all matters of governance falls far short of what was required. The urban-rural divide, as exposed by the BBS survey, is yet to be adequately addressed. According to the survey, moderate to severe food insecurity is prevalent among 20.94 per cent of urban people while it is 25.75 per cent among their rural counterparts. If the survey brought incomes of men and women living in rural and urban settings, the gender discrimination would be grossly exposed too. With such disparities in society, no nation can break the cycle of poverty.\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

They are quite eager to reach the voters, and their supporters have already started disfiguring the city skylines with large billboard, banners, posters and graffiti. \nThe city has already lost much of its greenery to unplanned urbanisation. Whatever green spaces still exist are obscured by soaring publicity offensive and tools used for the purpose such as billboards, banners and posters, hung indiscriminately here and there by different groups, individuals and institutions. With the elections around the corner, this existing problem of visual pollution, which is also a source of mental disturbance, is set to grow worse.\nAlthough the Election Commission has introduced new campaign rules, banning posters and limiting each candidate to a maximum of 20 billboards, these rules have been observed more in the breach than in its observance. Even though the election is still more than three months away and the official campaign period is scheduled to begin only three weeks before polling day as per EC guidelines, almost all roadside structures in areas such as Jatrabari, Paltan, Gulistan, Shahbagh and Farmgate have already been flooded with large billboards and posters. \nEven the metro rail pillars have not been spared, as they too are plastered with large banners and campaign materials. Posters and banners are also popping up even in narrow alleys, and very few roadside walls remain free of graffiti. Property owners complain that they cannot keep their boundary walls clean for even a single day after repainting, as posters and graffiti reappear almost overnight. And yet, they say cannot do anything about it as those responsible for this offence are influential people. \nIt is deeply regrettable that aspiring members of parliament, who are expected to lead by example, show little regard for public sentiment. They seem indifferent to the fact that building and shop owners may not share their political views, and even if they do, they are unlikely to appreciate seeing their walls defaced by campaign materials. \nMoreover, elections generate an enormous amount of waste from campaign materials. Candidates apparently spend huge amount of money in producing these traditional election campaign materials. These materials are discarded shortly after polling. They have almost no societal benefits either. At the same time, in this era of social media dominance, voters are increasingly unlikely to be swayed solely by a candidate's banners and posters. \nMoreover, as the cities lack the infrastructure to recycle or safely dispose of such vast quantities of plastic, the campaign materials litter streets, rivers and drainage systems, causing severe water pollution and harming aquatic ecosystems. According to the Environment and Social Development Organisation (ESDO), approximately 27,000 tonnes of plastic-wrapped posters, banners, cards, and leaflets were used during the 12th national elections. Dhaka alone accounted for 17,000 tonnes of plastic waste.\nThe last general election was one-sided. This time, with heightened competition among multiple parties and candidates, the volume of campaign materials is expected to be far higher. Considering this, it was encouraging to see that the Election Commission in June proposing a set of environmentally friendly campaigning measures, including the use of eco-friendly materials, a ban on polythene and rexine, a complete prohibition on posters, restrictions on banners, and a noise limit of 60 decibels for loudspeakers. Unfortunately, members of different political parties have already started flouting those restrictions.\nAs climate change intensifies and Bangladesh faces growing threats from floods, rising sea levels and extreme weather events, it is crucial that the Election Commission and political parties take responsibility for reducing the waste generated through election campaign. Implementing environmentally conscious campaign strategies by utilising technology such as telecommunication and social media is essential to safeguarding public health and social well-being. By broadcasting speeches, discussions, and election manifesto online, parties and candidates can reach a broader audience and enable citizens to participate from anywhere. This interactive approach not only promotes inclusivity but also encourages active public engagement in a greener, more sustainable electoral process.\nAt the same time, by adopting sustainable campaign practices, including banning single-use plastics and PVC materials and encouraging the use of biodegradable alternatives, aspiring MP candidates have the opportunity to move towards a greener, cleaner electoral process that protects both urban and natural environments. Campaign through online platforms, televised debates and digital manifestos can not only minimise the massive paper and plastic waste generated during campaigns but also foster more substantive, issue-based political discourse. Such a shift would empower voters to make informed choices based on policy and performance rather than mere visibility, while simultaneously supporting a more sustainable and environmentally responsible democratic process.\nA green election campaign that prioritises environmental protection can bring numerous benefits to society. It can help create cleaner surroundings and foster a more peaceful community free from noise pollution. Maintaining clean public spaces also contributes positively to the psychological and physical well-being of citizens, promoting a healthier and more peaceful living environment. MP candidates, who aspire to lead the country in the future, should demonstrate a good sense of civic responsibility and a better understanding of urban aesthetics by conducting environmentally friendly election campaigns that reduce their carbon footprint and avoid causing public nuisance.\naktuhin.fexpress@gmail.com\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The rise of 'eat-out' and social-media driven trends has shifted consumption patterns among urban citizens and taken a new dimension. What was once limited to simple tea stalls and traditional snacks has evolved into a diverse, urban food market, driven by young entrepreneurs. \nAt Agaragaon, informal bakery stalls have clustered together into hubs, commonly termed as \"Cake Potti\" where home bakers sell affordable desserts to office-goers and metro commuters. Most are home-based bakers and cooks, using modest capital and leveraging informal channels for low-entry entrepreneurship which empowers youth and women with limited investment.\nGulshan street corners serve a variety of fusion kebabs, doi fuchkas, viral chips, flavored teas catering to both busy professionals as well as youth seeking a refreshing 'adda' with their friends. Items are sold from carts or trunks of parked cars - a modern form of the traditional hawker. These micro-ventures highlight the resilience and creativity of Bangladesh's informal sector as well as the emergence of a hybrid retail model, where social media marketing meets street-level direct selling. \nThese developments illustrate how Bangladesh's informal economy is innovating at the grassroots level. It also reflects a shift in consumer behaviour which can complement Bangladesh's formal food and hospitality industry if provided with proper policy support.\nHowever, the rapid growth also raises questions about policy gaps in urban regulation, hygiene and infrastructure. Vendors may lack access to clean water, waste disposal, and food safety training. Lack of regulation, parking issues, and food safety concerns or counterfeit products may create urban management challenges.\nTo sustain this momentum, city corporations could introduce licensed street food zones, provide microcredit access, and partner with SME agencies to upskill vendors.\nAs Bangladesh aims for diversified growth, authorities can explore ways to formalise and support safety, where they can help build a more resilient and inclusive business ecosystem instead of periodic eviction drives.\nSamiya Hossain, BBA\nNorth South University \nsamiya.hossain.232northsouth.edu\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It has been proven that because of digital finance and supportive digital infrastructure participation and resulting increase in business participation and outcomes among women are a material increase, but the potential has not been equally realised without opportunities to coordinate policy and access to finance.\nPractically, three successful levers should be broadened by the government and other development partners. First, micro-credit scale and partitioned windows that are offered to women business proprietors with lighter collateral and expedited approval procedures. Second, promote low-cost mobile data packages or collaborate with telecommunication providers to create packages targeting women to make digital advertising and transactions cheap and secure. Third, invest in intensive online up-skilling (several-hours certified online listing, online payment, online customer care and online cybersecurity) offered by universities, non-governmental organisations and even business incubators.\nThe players of the private sector such as marketplaces, fintechs and logistics providers will also need to establish gender-friendly onboarding (streamlined KYC, minimum balances) and mentorship programs that are female oriented by pairing experienced entrepreneurs with new founders.\nEmpowering women to build sustainable businesses is not merely a social goal; it is an economic multiplier. It increases the household incomes, expands domestic demand, and it diversifies the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Timely policy will transform shaky recovery into sustainable, inclusive growth.\nNajiza Israt Rifa\nnajiza.rifa@northsouth.edu\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
