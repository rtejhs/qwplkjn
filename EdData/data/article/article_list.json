In 16 days, the campaign would cover 1,300km across 20 districts and is to conclude in Patna on September 1. On August 27, the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, M.K. Stalin, joined Mr. Gandhi, Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Tejashwi Yadav and CPI-ML leader Dipankar Bhattacharya in Muzaffarpur. Mr. Stalin has accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of turning the Election Commission of India (ECI) into a puppet. NCP leader Sharad Pawar, SP leader Akhilesh Yadav, senior leaders of the TMC and Left parties will be in Patna on the concluding day. Its merits apart, the allegation that an ECI scheme favours the BJP and disadvantages the Opposition has rattled India\u2019s political landscape. This alleged \u201cvote chori (vote theft\u201d) has become the Opposition\u2019s central rallying cry. Mr. Gandhi\u2019s speeches consistently accuse the BJP of \u201cmanipulating institutions\u201d and using the ECI as a puppet for its political ends. The Opposition has long been complaining about various aspects of the electoral process that have become less transparent and more partisan. Political battles should have been on the issues of governance and livelihoods, and not on the integrity of the elections at all.The Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar and the demonstrable loopholes in electoral rolls, exposed by Mr. Gandhi through an analysis of one Assembly constituency in Karnataka, have given the Opposition allegation a strong handle. The ECI, through its conduct and responses, has added credence to the allegations. It has claimed that over 98% of the voters in the existing list have submitted an enrolment form as required in the Bihar SIR. Around 65 lakh names from the previous list have been removed from the draft list published. It took an order by the Supreme Court for the ECI to accept the Aadhaar card as an acceptable document for establishing identity. Mr. Gandhi alleges that the names being removed are predominantly those of the poor, Dalits, Other Backward Classes, Extremely Backward Classes and minorities, a larger proportion of whom vote for non-BJP parties. Electoral malpractice has united the Opposition, but the charges, much of them overblown, are a sign of institutional distrust and rot. The Opposition space has been severely restricted by the brazen and arbitrary use of central law enforcement agencies, and the ECI has done little to demonstrate its impartiality. All of this has left the Opposition with an approach of discrediting the electoral process, which in itself is a sad commentary on India\u2019s democracy.READ MORE Published - August 29, 2025 12:20 am IST\n                          Read  Comments \n                Copy link  \n                        \n            \n                    Email     \n                                \n                \n                Facebook   \n                        \n            \n                Twitter    \n                        \n            \n                Telegram     \n                        \n            \n                LinkedIn     \n                        \n            \n                WhatsApp\n                \n                        \n            \n                Reddit      \n                        \n            READ LATER\n                    Remove     \n                \n                SEE ALL         \n                PRINT\n            Related Topics\n        \n                        Indian National Congress\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Rahul Gandhi\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Bihar\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Bihar Assembly Elections 2025\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        politics\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        political parties\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Patna\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Tamil Nadu\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Rashtriya Janata Dal\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Bharatiya Janata Party\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Nationalist Congress Party\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Samajwadi Party\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Uttar Pradesh\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        ministers (government)\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        All India Trinamool Congress\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Election Commission of India\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        voting\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Supreme Court\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        dalits\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Caste\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        minority group\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        India\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        democracy\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Aadhaar",

        "full_article": "Heavy rain has left a trail of destruction across North India. Several districts have been cut off across Himachal Pradesh. Jammu and Kashmir reported over 40 deaths while swollen rivers breached flood marks in Srinagar and Anantnag. In Punjab, entire villages have been inundated and farmland has disappeared. The national capital, too, reported excessive rainfall and a surging Yamuna. The intensity and the volumes of the southwest monsoon have been swinging sharply between the extremes. August\u2019s rain has arrived in concentrated bursts, overwhelming fragile slopes in the Himalaya, bursting banks in the plains, and inundating low-lying regions. This erraticism has cut across geographies in a sign of the monsoon\u2019s increasing unpredictability. The consequences go beyond immediate damage. Intense rain over short periods amplifies local erosion. Mountain slopes destabilise and raise risks for settlements far removed. Relief, in this context, cannot be confined to reactive measures. The knowledge that concentrated, destructive rainfall is now a recurring possibility makes it imperative for States and the Centre to invest in preventive strategies. Continuing to treat such events as unforeseeable emergencies is to deny the evidence already at hand.Indeed, framing each calamity as \u201cunprecedented\u201d distracts from the lessons that should already have been learnt. In Himalayan States, forest clearance and road-widening continue sans adjustments such as slope-safe engineering in eco-sensitive zones despite experts warning of irreversibly weakened slopes. As catchments\u2019 buffering capacity shrinks, the chance of slope failure rises while silt accumulates in dams and rivers downstream, worsening the flood load. Yet, despite repeated disasters, the early warning and evacuation architecture remains underdeveloped. The capacity to forecast heavy rain has improved but it is not being translated into reliable ground-level warnings. Relief agencies mobilise once the damage has occurred, but systematic drills, pre-positioned supplies and community preparedness remain insufficient. Sadly, States and the Centre continue to pursue strategic road projects and urban expansion with urgency, even in landscapes repeatedly flagged as unstable, while climate-resilient infrastructure lags. Compensatory afforestation and rehabilitation rarely match the qualitative attributes of what has been lost. The cumulative effect is visible as denuded slopes, shrinking catchment areas, and populations at increasingly higher risk. Relief operations command headlines and budgets but unless sustainable infrastructure, landslide mitigation and early-warning systems are pursued equally seriously, the next monsoon spell will launch another cycle of loss. Shifting from acclaiming resilience, post facto, to systematically reducing vulnerabilities beforehand remains overdue.\rREAD MORE Published - August 29, 2025 12:10 am IST\n                          Read  Comments \n                Copy link  \n                        \n            \n                    Email     \n                                \n                \n                Facebook   \n                        \n            \n                Twitter    \n                        \n            \n                Telegram     \n                        \n            \n                LinkedIn     \n                        \n            \n                WhatsApp\n                \n                        \n            \n                Reddit      \n                        \n            READ LATER\n                    Remove     \n                \n                SEE ALL         \n                PRINT\n            Related Topics\n        \n                        rains\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        India\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        rivers\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Himachal Pradesh\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Jammu and Kashmir\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Punjab\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        farmland\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Monsoon\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        mountains\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        geography\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        natural disasters\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        disaster management\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        disaster (general)\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        forests\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        environmental issues\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        flood\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Jammu and Kashmir Floods\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        government\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        road transport\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        relief and aid organisation\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        engineering\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        technology (general)\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        weather science",

But what does Bihar have to offer them?\nBihar\u2019s allies in govt, JDU and BJP, used Stalin\u2019s stop in Bihar \u2013 he was there to support ally Congress \u2013 to revive earlier DMK slurs against Bihari migrants in Tamil Nadu. Stalin and his ministers sought to focus instead on fresh MoSPI data on Thursday that crowned TN as India\u2019s most industrialised state and top employer of factory workers. Bihar and TN couldn\u2019t be further apart. Bihar remains stuck at the bottom, caste networks cementing its place in poverty and poor human development. TN, despite its own caste politics, has pushed ahead, steadily progressing economically, and in inclusivity and human development performance. Certainly, TN\u2019s success shines brighter also because Bihar sets the bar so low.\nPoles apart \u2013 one\u2019s society led by upper castes, the other Dravidian \u2013 yet the two states are inseparable, bound by an endless stream of migrants. Bihar pushes them out, TN pulls them in. Anti-migrant politics is central to political right\u2019s appeal globally. It is no different in TN \u2013 small parties like NTK are ever-ready to whip up migrant hate. Two years ago, TN authorities swiftly tackled misinformation about attacks on Bihari migrants. Notably, Chennai and Patna together killed the attempt at stirring trouble. Now, ahead of Bihar\u2019s election later this year and TN\u2019s in about six months, the Bihari migrant finds himself, and his fate, at the centre of political sparring.\nBut the bigger tragedy is that these migrants \u2013 who build India\u2019s gleaming cities \u2013- barely get to exercise their vote. There are concerns that thousands of migrants\u2019 names are missing from Bihar\u2019s SIR draft rolls. A good number stands to lose jobs in TN\u2019s export hubs post Trump tariffs. But before rallying them to the hustings \u2013 if they\u2019re part of the voter rolls \u2013 Nitish & Tejashwi might want to spell out what Bihar has to offer.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Every election season, politicians start talking loudly about Bihari migrants. But what does Bihar itself really give to them?\nRecently, when Tamil Nadu leader Stalin visited Bihar, old fights about how people from Bihar are treated in Tamil Nadu came up again. Tamil Nadu is now India\u2019s most industrialised state, with lots of factories and jobs. Bihar, on the other hand, is still among the poorest states, with little industry and weak schools and healthcare. That\u2019s why so many people leave Bihar to find work elsewhere.\nThe two states are very different \u2013 one is shaped by upper-caste politics, the other by Dravidian politics. Yet they are tied together because Bihar keeps sending out workers, and Tamil Nadu keeps needing them. But sometimes, politics makes life harder for these workers. In Tamil Nadu, a few small parties try to stir up anti-migrant feelings. Just two years ago, fake news about Biharis being attacked spread online, but both Patna and Chennai worked fast to stop the tension.\nNow, with elections coming up in both states, Bihari migrants are back in the political spotlight. The sad truth is that the same workers who build India\u2019s shiny cities often cannot even vote, because their names are missing from Bihar\u2019s voter list. On top of that, many may lose jobs in Tamil Nadu\u2019s factories because of new US tariffs.\nSo before leaders in Bihar ask migrants for votes, maybe they should answer this simple question: What future does Bihar really offer its own people?\n\n",

This crash created the Himalayas \u2013 the tallest mountain range in the world.\nThese mountains are more than just pretty scenery. They protect India like a shield \u2013 stopping icy winds from the north and trapping the monsoon clouds that bring us rain. Without the Himalayas, India would have been dry and barren, and maybe we wouldn\u2019t have had such an old and rich civilisation, or even such a huge population today.\nThe Himalayas also give us forests, animals, rivers, waterfalls, hydropower, and incredible natural beauty. They\u2019re deeply connected to our history, religion, and mythology. In short, the Himalayas are part of who we are.\nBut recently, the mountains have been suffering. Heavy rains, floods, and landslides in Jammu, Himachal, Uttarakhand, Arunachal, and the northeast show us that the Himalayas are warning us. Climate change is making rainfall more extreme, and since the Himalayas are still \u201cyoung\u201d mountains (they actually rise about 1 cm every year!), they are fragile and can\u2019t handle too much damage.\nOur ancestors knew this. They built homes and temples with mud and timber that could withstand disasters. The British, when they built the Shimla railway, made sure the hills stayed safe. But now, we often ignore the risks \u2013 cutting trees, building hotels on riverbeds, making highways too close to the treeline, and raising high-rises on shaky land. This leads to tragedies like cars getting stranded in floods or villages being washed away.\nThe Himalayas are trying to tell us something: respect nature, or pay the price.\n\n",

        "full_article": "The beats of faith, the pause of silence\nIt is that time of the year again when Mumbai dons its sequins and speakers, and Lord Ganesha, remover of obstacles, patron of beginnings, arrives as the most celebrated guest of honour. The Universal Host is welcomed as a guest into our homes, pandals, and streets, with decibel levels that ensure the city stays awake for nine days.\nSages speak of awakening supreme consciousness; DJs excel at supreme restlessness with bass-heavy beats of\u00a0Deva Shree Ganesha\u00a0that leave even the Lord\u2019s mouse scurrying for earplugs. The festival has, of course, evolved. Once, idols were moulded from humble backyard clay and returned gently to the waters. Now they are bought from vendors, cast in plaster of Paris and coated in glitter, stubbornly refusing to merge in the Arabian Sea much like certain waistlines that refuse to recede after modak season.\nWhat was once ritual has become rave. The new commandment reads:\u00a0If thy loudspeaker is not louder than thy neighbour\u2019s, thy devotion does not count.\u00a0Those who now complain about noise pollution forget that it was their own youthful exuberance that turned Lord Ganesha from Nirvikalpa (formless consciousness) into Dolby Digital. HIS elephantine wisdom of patience, tolerance, and self-control has been reinterpreted into traffic jams, selfie-seeking crowds, and Insta reels. And unless the new generation chooses to rediscover self-discipline, they too will inherit the same fate, limitless decibels and sleepless nights.\nStill, for all its excesses, Ganesh Chaturthi is the nation\u2019s grand overture to the festive season that runs till Diwali, a reminder that life is not only about seeking purpose, but about celebrating it with rhythm, reason, and ritual.\nSo dance while the music plays, for tomorrow the streets must sleep, the idols must return to the elements, reminding us that just as clay becomes form and form returns to clay, so too does human life and the Lord, with HIS infinite patience, will return, bemused yet benevolent, to witness our encore next year. Today\u2019s generation, thankfully, is already mindful of going green to protect the seas; it is only a matter of time before they also awaken to the perils of sound pollution. That, perhaps, will be their true\u00a0sound advice\u00a0to the next generation to usher in a cultural change where this great festival is not about a loud awakening to sound, but about a sound awakening of consciousness.\n\n",

In the current fiscal year 2024-25, the situation has reached a new low, with only 21 per cent of the ADP implemented -- the worst performance among all government agencies. This dismal record has left the country's health services increasingly fragile and unable to respond effectively to mounting challenges. Despite increases in budget allocations over the years, the ministry -- one of the country's key stakeholders -- has consistently failed to deliver. Analysts point out that while funding has grown, execution capacity has remained stagnant, if not deteriorated. What is even more concerning, according to sources, is that the government has neither questioned nor held ministry officials accountable for these repeated failures. Data from the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division (IMED) of the Planning Commission highlight the long-standing nature of the problem. For over a decade, the Health Services Division (HSD) under the ministry has lagged behind the national average in ADP execution. In FY2025, the HSD managed to implement only 21 per cent of its projects, compared with the national average of 67.85 per cent. Even in FY2024, when the ministry performed somewhat better, it completed only 76.65 per cent of its projects, still trailing the national average of 80.92 per cent.\nBangladesh's overall public investment in health is alarmingly low. In FY2025, health spending stood at only 0.74 per cent of GDP -- well below the South Asian average and a fraction of what developed countries invest. For two decades, this figure has remained under 1.0 per cent, underlining the government's continued neglect of the sector. Although the health sector received 5.20 per cent of the national budget this year, weak project implementation has drastically limited the impact of this allocation. A lack of institutional capacity is often cited as the main cause of underperformance. Experts explain that this refers to inexperienced manpower, many of whom lack the necessary skills to implement projects effectively. The situation is worsened by insufficient monitoring and supervision. Moreover, allegations of widespread corruption, misuse of resources and irregularities in infrastructure projects and procurement further undermine the system.\nThe persistent failure of the health ministry in executing its budgetary commitments has had dire consequences. It may be recalled how the health system was grossly underprepared to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic, despite emergency allocations. The crisis laid bare the governance flaws in the sector, showing that even the funds spent yielded limited benefits. The same shortcomings continue to hinder effective management of recurring public health threats, such as dengue and chikungunya, which claim lives every year.\nGiven the critical importance of healthcare-related projects under the ADP, the health ministry's repeated underperformance raises pressing questions. How does the ministry explain such gross failure, and more importantly, what measures are being taken to correct this long-standing problem? Without decisive reforms in project execution, accountability and governance, Bangladesh's health sector risks remaining perpetually unfit to serve the nation's needs.\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "full_article": "\n / EDITORIAL\n   Nilratan Halder   |  \n       August 29, 2025 00:00:00  \n\nBangladesh's logistical paucity is endemic. It ranges from all ports -- land, sea and air -- to digital system to road and rail communication to distribution and supply chains. It goes to the credit of the interim government for making an attempt to develop a multimodal logistics system centring around the country's premier Chittagong Port and connecting other two sea ports, Mongla and Pyra. Obviously, the emphasis is on the development of the capacity of the Chittagong Port. Facts speak for the overwhelming necessity of doing this. \nRight now, the Chittagong Port's handling capacity is limited to just 2.86 million TEU (Twenty-foot equivalent unit), a standard unit of measurement for volume in the maritime shipping industry but it has to overstress itself to handle 3.3 million TEUs a year. No wonder that at a seminar organized by the FE recently, the keynote deliverer, Prof Md Mamun Habib of the School of Business and Entrepreneurship at the Independent University, Bangladesh cited that Bangladesh lags far behind its South Asian peers in global logistics ranking. How does it trail is evident from the World Bank's Logistics Performance Index (LPI). The country's ranking was as low as 88th compared to India's 38th and Sri Lanka's 73rdin 2023. Chairman of Policy Exchange, Manzur Reaz, was even more critical in observing that the country is 'five decades behind' in developing logistics as a sector and 'a decade behind' since the formulation of the National Logistics Policy. \nThe result is for all to see: container handling, as revealed by a BGMEA's senior vice-president, at the Chittagong Port takes five to six days compared to the global standard of one to two days. It is against all these constraints, Bangladesh has taken up an ambitious plan to elevate the Chittagong Port to a regional hub of maritime operation. The challenges are daunting but if executed under the integrated National Logistics Policy, this is not beyond reach within a reasonable time frame. \nA follow-up story carried in the FE yesterday shows that some progress in processing the system has already been made. At the seminar of the FE, mention was made for development of three bay terminals which will achieve the capacity to handle 5.36 million TEUs by 2036. Now, the latest report asserts that the Chittagong Port Authority has planned to 'implement, upgrade and operate' four major terminal projects under the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model. The year 2036 is a long way off. But to go by the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority chairman, international tendering process for several Chittagong Port was underway and the plan was to appoint the first operator at the New-mooring Container Terminal (NCT), Laldia Container Terminal and one bay terminal by December this year at the latest. \nEarlier, though, the three bay terminals were scheduled to be developed by the Chittagong Port Authority, PSA Singapore and DP World under a PPP G-to-G model. Now the latest report holds that four projects to be implemented under the model are Laldia Container Terminal, bay terminals (1 and 2), the new NCT including the overflow container yard and Patenga Container Terminal. The government has already decided to hand over the responsibility of handling the bay terminals to foreign operators preferably to PSA Singapore and Dubai-based DP World. Saudi RSGT is likely to take over the handling of Patenga Terminal under a 22-year PPP agreement. Finally, Denmark's APM will take the responsibility of constructing the automated Laldia Terminal. \nHere are two phases in the projects -- development or expansion of facilities and operation. Operation can be efficient and timely only if the supporting system is geared to trigger the entire process. Development of infrastructural facilities take time, particularly when it concerns bay terminals and their integration with the communication system, supply and distribution chains. There is no point repeating rhetoric, better it would be to inform the public of the phase-wise development of the logistics that also envisions connecting the other two ports. Allowing just one dedicated train under the private operation to maintain the supply chain when the multimodal logistics are equipped to support the country's projected foreign exchange earnings targeted at $1,000 billion.\nEfficient operation of the terminals by foreign companies may reduce costs slightly but there may still remain many a slip between the cup and the lip. This is certainly not going to help the cause much because businesses have already resented the sudden 40 per cent hike in charges at the Chittagong Port. Their grievance may further deepen with further escalation of charges, if it happens anyway after the foreign companies take over the responsibility of terminal handling. The priority ought to be putting in place the advanced and automated infrastructure first and then proceed to hand over the handling responsibility to foreign companies with genuine track records. \nTheir performance will tell the story. If by the end of December, they take over the responsibility, it is not a long way off. Let the nation wait until that time to see how far progress in installing advanced and automated system has been made. Sure enough, the other challenge involving connection of the ports under a multimodal network to turn the other two seaports efficient and the Chittagong Port a hub must also be taken up quite seriously.\nnilratanhalder2000@yahoo.com\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Beginning from posh global footwear and apparel brands such as Adidas, Puma, Nike and Levi's to spectacles brands such as Gucci, Prada and Chanel are being sold on online platforms and even in local shops at prices lower than even many of the locally produced items. How is it possible? There are no logical explanation behind it. Rather, counterfeits and shipment diversions lie behind this trend, which are constituting challenges that may have long-term consequences for prospective local brands, consumer safety and the country's reputation.\nThe major reason for global brands becoming so cheap in Bangladesh is the influx of counterfeit goods, mainly from China. Traders are importing items bearing the logos of posh global brands, which are not produced by brand owners. These products are manufactured in factories that specialise in making look-alike items with poor quality. Once those arrive in Bangladesh, the items are sold online through platforms like Facebook shops, e-commerce sites, and even in so-called physical brand shops. As they are fake, they can be sold cheaper than locally manufactured products. However, it does not necessarily mean that the ones being sold by so-called brand shops at high prices are genuine. Mobile court drives conducted by the Directorate of Consumer Rights Protection discovered on several occasions that shops claiming to be dealing in branded items are selling products not sourced from the original brand owners.\nCounterfeit imports are badly affecting local fashion brands. Businesses which have invested in creating domestic brands are encountering unfair competition from those who are selling counterfeits at prices lower than that of local products. The availability of counterfeits discourages innovation and weakens consumer trust in local brands, thus hampering their growth.\nCounterfeit products sometimes expose consumers to hazards as they, unlike genuine brands, bypass strict safety and quality testing processes. For example, a pair of cheap fake sneakers may cause injuries, skin irritation, or simply wear out within days.\nThe fascination for foreign brands also shows deeper issues in consumer psychology. Many Bangladeshis, especially young people, view wearing items with foreign brand logos as a symbol of status, even if the product is fake. Such craving for foreign logos, even at the expense of quality, reflects the bankruptcy of mind. This is one of the reasons why local brands are struggling to earn the recognition it deserves despite the fact that Bangladesh is a powerhouse in apparel production.\nThe authorities concerned need to play their parts to reverse the situation. They need to strengthen border controls and customs surveillance to prevent the influx of counterfeit goods from China and other countries. E-commerce should be brought under regulation so that they cannot deal online in counterfeit items. Consumer awareness is equally important. Buyers need to understand that if something appears too cheap, it probably is not genuine. The risks of buying counterfeit goods should be made public through campaigns and the media could play a great role here. Local brands should be given necessary support to develop their own identities. When domestic consumers will trust and value local brands, the demand for counterfeits will naturally decline.\nPolicymakers need to consider the long-term implications of this on the country's image. The apparel industry contributes over 80 percent of export earnings while Bangladeshi footwear is consolidating global footprint. In such a situation, any perception that Bangladesh is a safe haven for counterfeits could undermine years of progress in building trust with global buyers. To avert it, the country needs to ensure that intellectual property laws are enforced properly.\nrahmansrdk@gmail.com\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

With increasing demand on account of rapid urbanisation, industrial growth, and rising living standards, the reliance on conventional fossil fuels is proving unsustainable. According to the Bangladesh Power Development Board, the country's total installed electricity capacity has exceeded 25,000 MW. However, more than 30 per cent of rural households still experience irregular electricity supply. Simultaneously, heavy dependence on natural gas and imported fuel threatens both environmental sustainability and energy security.\nRenewable energy offers a transformative solution. Solar, wind, and biomass technologies have matured globally, presenting viable alternatives to conventional energy sources. The government's \"Solar Home System\" programme has already benefited over 5.0 million rural households, underscoring the potential for clean energy expansion. However, despite these achievements, the penetration of renewables remains low compared to regional peers. Bangladesh derives only about 3.0 per cent of its electricity from renewable sources. In contrast, India and Vietnam have achieved 12-15 per cent in the same period.\nInvesting in renewable energy can stimulate economic growth while creating employment opportunities. Solar farms, wind energy projects, and biomass plants require skilled human resources for installation, operation, and maintenance. Expanding decentralised renewable solutions, such as community solar microgrids and small-scale wind turbines, can bridge this gap. International collaborations with organisations such as the UNDP, GIZ, and ADB can support technical expertise, financing and capacity building for large-scale adoption of clean energy solutions.\nPolicy support is critical. Incentives such as tax exemptions, low-interest loans for renewable energy startups, and feed-in tariffs can encourage private sector participation. Moreover, integrating renewable energy education in vocational institutes and universities may cultivate a workforce skilled in clean energy technologies, ensuring long-term sustainability.\nEnvironmental benefits are equally compelling. By reducing its reliance on fossil fuels, Bangladesh can lower carbon emissions, enhance air quality, and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Additionally, renewable energy projects can help reduce pressure on natural resources, thereby preserving rivers, forests and ecosystems -- a prerequisite for livelihoods and biodiversity.\nSo, promoting renewable energy is not just an environmental necessity but an economic opportunity for Bangladesh. By prioritising investment, policy incentives, skill development, and urban-rural energy equity, Bangladesh can secure a sustainable energy future, create jobs, and strengthen resilience against climate risks. Policymakers, private investors and civil society need to collaborate in promoting renewable energy for a greener Bangladesh.\nTowfiq Sultan\nLecturer, Brave Jubilant Scholars of\nMonohardi Model College, \nNarsingdi.\ntowfiqsultan.help@gmail.com\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
