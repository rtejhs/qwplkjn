At least four persons were killed and at least 60 people are feared washed away after a mass of water, debris and muck triggered by torrential rain hit the Kheer Ganga river on Tuesday afternoon. The flood hit hotels and residential buildings in Dharali town, situated 8,600 feet above sea level, where video footage recorded by residents showed giant waves of water gushing through the area, engulfing people and homes. Several Indian Army personnel are also feared dead, according to preliminary reports.The proximate cause of the disaster is the extremely heavy rainfall from August 3 to 5, with some parts of the district reporting nearly 30 cm of rainfall over a single day due to the monsoon and its active phase over North India. The fury and the volume of the water that gushed through the town seemed to suggest that this was a sudden event, prompting State officials to categorise it as a \u2018cloudburst\u2019. However, this has a very specific meaning in how the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the official forecaster, defines it. A large volume of rain, of at least 10 centimetres in an hour over 10 square kilometres, is what usually qualifies as a cloudburst. The lack of weather radars at those altitudes means that the IMD is incapable of such a computation. Therefore, it could very well be that continuous heavy rain over the past 48 hours may have loosened the soil and combined with the craggy, undulating terrain, unleashed large volumes of silt along with copious amounts of water. Whether it was a sudden event or the result of a gradual build-up might seem only of academic interest, given the loss of life, livelihood and property. The knee-jerk categorisation as a \u2018cloudburst\u2019 allows state authorities to claim helplessness. Once it is projected as a freak phenomenon, the event only elicits social media commiseration from public authorities in the form of \u2018prayers\u2019 and \u2018deep sadness\u2019 and a pre-defined token sum as disbursement. The recent past shows that these are anything but outliers. Climate change has increased the probability of extreme rainfall events and, therefore, the numerous infrastructure projects undertaken in the hills and the resulting debris act as latent explosives that are triggered from such rainfall. Following relief operations, the State government must \u2014 as soon as conditions are conducive \u2014 review debris and silt accumulation at critical points in the State to buffer the inevitable damage from climate change.\r Published - August 07, 2025 12:20 am IST\n                          Read  Comments \n                Copy link  \n                        \n            \n                    Email     \n                                \n                \n                Facebook   \n                        \n            \n                Twitter    \n                        \n            \n                Telegram     \n                        \n            \n                LinkedIn     \n                        \n            \n                WhatsApp\n                \n                        \n            \n                Reddit      \n                        \n            READ LATER\n                    Remove     \n                \n                SEE ALL         \n                PRINT\n            Related Topics\n        \n                        Uttarakhand\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        natural disasters\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        mountains\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        rains\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        armed Forces\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Monsoon\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        technology (general)\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        climate change\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        government",

        "full_article": "The Supreme Court of India\u2019s recent handling of defamation charges against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi marks a troubling shift from established norms of free speech and jurisprudence on constitutional protections for political discourse. This became clear when the Bench led by Justice Dipankar Datta, while staying the proceedings on Mr. Gandhi\u2019s remarks on the Galwan clash in 2020, made problematic oral observations. Among others, Justice Datta said that had Mr. Gandhi been a \u201ctrue Indian\u201d, he would not have said what he did. The Court\u2019s primary function is to adjudicate on questions of law and constitutional principle rather than to prescribe standards of national loyalty. In a democracy, surely a \u2018true Indian\u2019 is one who fearlessly pursues the truth and holds the government accountable \u2014 not one who accepts official narratives without question. Mr. Gandhi\u2019s commentary, in which he questioned the government\u2019s border policies and drew attention to credible reports of Chinese intrusions, also fell well within the legitimate ambit of Opposition politics. This critiquing does not, and must not be seen to, undermine the nation. Such criticism is protected by the principles of free speech and is indispensable for a healthy public discourse. The Court\u2019s remarks, by implying otherwise, risk chilling legitimate dissent and setting an inimical precedent for future Opposition conduct.Equally, Mr. Gandhi\u2019s statements regarding Chinese occupation of Indian territory and confrontations are not without backing in public and governmental sources. Open-source satellite imagery, parliamentary discussions, and journalistic reports have documented the aftermath of the Galwan Valley clash, including new Chinese activities along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). A parliamentary committee report has acknowledged the loss of access to certain patrol points in eastern Ladakh. Military officials and independent analysts have corroborated, at various times, the ongoing disputes and loss of patrolling rights over substantial stretches of territory, including parts of Ladakh\u2019s Galwan and Depsang areas. Local residents are also unable to access grazing lands. The loss of about 2,000 square kilometres, cited by Mr. Gandhi, is also based on estimates by independent defence experts studying China\u2019s LAC transgressions. The general thrust of Mr. Gandhi\u2019s remarks \u2014 i.e., China has altered the status quo to India\u2019s disadvantage and that the government\u2019s public statements have not always aligned with ground realities \u2014 is supported by public evidence. Thus, the Court must resist the temptation to offer moral or patriotic judgments and instead direct its considerable energies to the rigorous and impartial adjudication of legal questions. Only by adhering to this principle can the Court reinforce its legitimacy and protect the tenets of free and open public debate.

        "full_article": "Put ecology before economy while developing mountain infra, or prepare for more Dharalis\nTuesday\u2019s flash flood in Uttarakhand\u2019s Dharali village shouldn\u2019t be dismissed as just another mountain disaster. Its causes might have been beyond human control, but human choices amplified the effects. Traditional hill homes are built on slopes and terraces, out of harm\u2019s way, but the buildings swept away by the torrent at Dharali had encroached on the floodplain. Reports say some three dozen hotels, homestays and shops were in the water\u2019s path. In good times, these were prime \u201cwaterfront\u201d properties, attracting pilgrims and tourists making a beeline for Gangotri hardly 20km away. Tuesday just happened to be a bad day.\nAs climate change makes such events more frequent, there will be more bad days across the hills. That\u2019s why choices we make now are crucial. Dharali is among the beneficiaries of govt\u2019s Char Dham push. Wider highways mean ease of travel, and tourist numbers have risen fast across the circuit. In 1956, minister OV Alagesan had told Lok Sabha: \u201cPeople have to walk four days to reach Badrinath.\u201d Road construction after the 1962 war, and bus services, boosted the visitor count to 2L. But what\u2019s happening now is unprecedented, and perhaps excessive. Last year, when the highway project was 75% complete, more than 14L visited Badrinath, and over 16L Kedarnath.\nInflux of millions of tourists, and their cars, into geologically fragile zones may be good for business, but is risky otherwise. Roads have been widened at the cost of forests, and hillsides and riverbeds burdened with concrete buildings everywhere, be it Garhwal, Shimla or Mandi. It\u2019s not surprising that all new mountain highway projects are plagued by landslides every day. That\u2019s why SC\u2019s remark last month, in connection with a Himachal case, deserves attention: \u201cEarning revenue is not everything. Revenue cannot be earned at the cost of environment and ecology.\u201d Other countries have trifled with nature and paid a price. The Soviets famously dried up Aral Sea by diverting the rivers that fed it, to grow more cotton. They got revenue, but at what cost? India must seriously weigh the intangible costs and benefits of its infra projects to avoid more Dharalis.\n\n",

Bet, many passers-by nodded sanctimoniously. However social media outrage over such sexist nonsense forced police to pull down what they themselves had green-lighted. Two senior officials red-facedly admitted that they\u2019d given permission for an NGO\u2019s \u2018traffic awareness\u2019 campaign \u2014 but had failed to check its content.\nSo once again women get the \u2018challan\u2019 for their violator\u2019s out-of-control libido \u2013 and leave the actual menace free to rape again The rare instances of men being told to refrain equally trivialise this grave and continuous crime. Haryana khap panchayat member Jitender Chhatar made the remarkable medical discovery that \u2018chowmein leads to hormonal imbalance evoking an urge to indulge in such acts\u2019. So MSG actually stands for \u2018male sexual glutamate\u2019? Wow!\nCPI leader Atul Kumar Anjan\u2019s finding was equally awesome. At a UP rally, he thundered that the \u2018condom ad featuring\u00a0 Sunny Leone will unleash more rapes\u2019. He got his come-uppance: he \u2018kept vomiting\u2019 after watching porn, \u2018only for one-or two minutes\u2019 and, of course, \u2018only for research purposes\u2019.\nSometimes \u201c\u2019Tis not in ourselves, but in our stars, that we are \u2026\u201d Endorsing Shakespeare, a\u00a0 Bangalore astrologer concluded that \u2018Aries women are likely to be raped in the bathroom\u2019 and a Capricornian victimised by \u2018father, mother or colleague\u2019.\u00a0 Sort of agreeing, the 94-year-old shankaracharya of Dwarka Peeth said women \u2018should stop all their drum-beating\u2019 over visiting the inner sanctum of Maharashtra\u2019s Shani Shingnapur temple. \u2018Worshipping Shani will bring ill luck to them and give rise to crimes against them like rape.\u2019 A day later, he blamed honeymooners and picnickers for the 2013 Kedarnath flash floods in Uttarakhand, warning that such a \u2018polluting\u2019 of sacred Hindu sites would lead to more disasters.\nSo now we know that women only are to blame for \u2018wearing tight clothes\u2019 and not obeying such important rules. They never get raped because they belong to wrong caste, creed or class. Who asked them work in a powerful politician\u2019s house or public hospital; go on assignment to deserted mills; or take a late bus home? What\u2019s rape got to do with our indulgently saying \u2018boys will be boys\u2019? Then, Sir, girls can also be girls, no?

        "full_article": "GOI has called out Trump\u2019s extra tariffs for what they are. He was wrong to think hegemony will work\nThree weeks from now, India will be the most heavily tariffed seller in the US market besides Brazil. Yesterday, through an executive order, Trump imposed an additional ad valorem duty of 25% on India for \u201cdirectly or indirectly importing Russian Federation oil\u201d, taking the total to 50%. GOI probably saw this coming from the time Trump\u2019s tone changed from friendly to brusque a week ago. Where he had talked up the chances of a trade deal with India on July 8 \u2013 \u201cWe are close to making a deal with India\u201d \u2013 on July 30 he slapped a 25% import duty along with the threat of an unspecified penalty. Now, the suspense is over.\nIt\u2019s impossible to fathom Trump\u2019s logic. From the start, China was the presumed target of his tariff war. US runs its largest goods trade deficit with Beijing \u2013 worth $295bn in 2024. At one point, Trump raised tariffs on China to 145%, but China\u2019s retaliation with a rare earths supply freeze made him see reason. Now, China is tariffed at 30%. If Russian oil triggers Trump, China and T\u00fcrkiye are also big buyers, yet they have not been \u201cpenalised\u201d.\nIt may be that Trump\u2019s acting in frustration. He had boasted he would end the Ukraine war within 24 hours of taking office, but six months have passed and Putin remains defiant. Perhaps, Trump believes stopping oil revenues will bring Putin to the table. And since he seems unable to touch China for now, India possibly seems like a softer target to him. But this is a huge mistake. For almost 80 years, India has refused to be cowed by hegemons. Yesterday, it termed Trump\u2019s action \u201cunfair, unjustified and unreasonable\u201d and made it clear it will \u201ctake all actions necessary to protect its national interests\u201d.\nAs TOI has said before, the current discount on Russian oil is so little that India saves not more than $2bn a year. It could easily pivot to West Asian oil, but the resultant increase in crude prices would hurt all. Besides, if India chooses to pivot, it won\u2019t be on Trump\u2019s terms.

In the afternoon of that day, the interim government chief, flanked by leaders of the different political parties, read out the July Declaration that encapsulates people's aspirations in the mass uprising in 2024 and, in the evening, in a televised address to the nation, he announced a definite timeline -- in February next, before the holy month of Ramadan -- for the next general election.\nDr Yunus has now pushed the ball into the court of the politicians. However, it will be his responsibility to ensure a free, fair, peaceful and credible election. Holding such an important national event under the prevailing circumstances is easier said than done, particularly when the relevant public agencies are not in order because of illegal political interference by the last autocratic regime. The latter had undermined most national institutions to cling to power. Institutional readiness apart, other issues of great import need to be taken into cognisance. Political parties have divergent stances on a few reforms, representation in parliament and poll timing. Though the National Consensus Commission (NCC) has been trying hard to get them to a common point, there are differences. The largest political party, BNP welcomed the announcement on polls immediately. Others, including Jamaat-e-Islami, Bangladesh and the National Citizens' Party (NCP) also welcomed it. However, they attached a few conditions. \nFor individual political parties, it is nothing unusual to bargain for what suit them most. But they possibly will not contest the fact that a free, fair and credible election is the need of the hour. The necessity of holding polls without further delay is not only for the restoration of the people's right to vote, but also for the sake of economy. Businesses are longing for the early transition to democracy and the installation of a government elected by the people in a free, fair and peaceful election. Political uncertainty, poor law and order, and decline in consumption expenditure and banking sector ills have been deeply troubling them. Though the country's balance of payments and forex reserves situation has made notable improvement because of deft handling by the incumbent governor of the central bank, overall, the economy is not in a good shape. Slowdown in private investment and decline in employment growth are the best indicators here. Blame for such a deplorable situation largely goes to Sheikh Hasina's government. Her party stalwarts, loyalists and cronies emptied vaults of some public and private banks, plundered development project funds worth billions of dollars and laundered a large part of the same. \nThe interim government, headed by Dr Yunus, had shouldered a difficult yet enormous task, political or otherwise, after the fall of Sheikh Hasina's government. It would not be an exaggeration if one notes that the new administration failed to have the full grasp of the situation prevailing in many areas, and it faltered, primarily because of the lack of experience and seriousness of some advisers and post-uprising instability. Such deficiencies notwithstanding, Dr Yunus emerged as the man of the moment and a symbol of unanimity when the question of choosing a leader in the vacuum had arisen. Now he has stepped into the most important phase of his interim administration. He has to steer the electoral process up to the last with determination. The interim leader has appealed to the people to take part in the coming election, which, he said, will lay the foundation of a 'New Bangladesh'. The announcement involving the poll timing has removed uncertainty, at least partially. It remains to be seen how things unfold from here on.\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "full_article": "\n / EDITORIAL\n   Atiqul Kabir Tuhin   |  \n       August 07, 2025 00:00:00  \n\nThe recent reduction of the US reciprocal tariff on products imported from Bangladesh - from a previously declared 35 per cent to 20 per cent - has come as a much-needed relief for stakeholders in the Ready-Made Garment (RMG) industry. This development follows a flurry of diplomatic negotiations and concessions by Bangladesh, including increased imports from the US and a broad reduction in tariffs on US goods entering the country.\nThis tariff relief places Bangladesh's RMG sector, responsible for approximately 84 per cent of the country's export earnings and for which the US is the single largest export destination, on a more level playing field with key competitors like Vietnam and Sri Lanka, which are subject to the same 20 per cent rate. In contrast, larger economies like India and China face tariffs of 25 per cent or more. Although some countries, such as Cambodia and Pakistan, have negotiated a slightly lower tariff of 19 per cent, Bangladesh's strong production capacity and well-established supply chains are expected to help offset this marginal difference.\nIn this context, RMG entrepreneurs can be cautiously optimistic about sustaining export growth to the US and capitalising on opportunities arising from supply chain shifts away from China. However, optimism must be tempered with realism, as several challenges persist, both international and domestic.\nOne of the most immediate concerns is cost burden. While US importers are officially expected to bear the increased tariffs and pass them on to consumers, inflationary pressures in the US may reduce demand for imported garments. Reports suggest that American buyers are already requesting Bangladeshi manufacturers to absorb a portion of the cost. This is a significant concern, given that many local manufacturers already operate with razor-thin profit margins. Further pressure on those margins could ultimately affect the industry's most vulnerable segment - the low-paid garment workers.\nAdding to these pressures are two recent domestic policy decisions that threaten to inflate logistical costs. The interim government's decision to increase charges at Chattogram Port by 40 per cent, along with a hike in fees at private inland container depots (ICDs) ranging from 30 to 100 per cent, risks further eroding the sector's competitiveness. At a time when global apparel markets are undergoing rapid transformation, such decisions could place Bangladesh at a disadvantage relative to regional competitors.\nAnother structural weakness is the RMG sector's heavy dependence on imported raw materials. Bangladesh's limited import substitution capacity leaves it vulnerable to the Rules of Origin (RoO) clause in the US tariff regime. This clause rewards manufacturers using US-origin inputs, but penalises those sourcing raw materials - such as fabrics and yarns - from third countries like China. The solution lies in long-term investments in backward linkage industries to reduce reliance on imports and develop domestic input sources.\nThe benefits from reduced tariffs will ultimately depend on how efficiently Bangladesh's industries can respond. While the country enjoys the advantage of low-cost labour, many factories' competitiveness is compromised by low hourly productivity and insufficient production capacity. However, there are signs of progress. Some factories have already increased output significantly by adopting modern Italian and Taiwanese machinery, leading not only to higher efficiency but also better pricing on select products. If this trend continues, and more units adopt smart technologies, production costs may fall and profit margins could rise.\nTo ensure sustainable growth, experts think that the RMG sector must focus on five key areas: strengthening backward integration; manufacturing more value-added products, particularly those based on man-made fibres (MMF); improving workforce skills and productivity; adopting advanced technologies in line with Industry 4.0; and enhancing sustainability to improve ESG scores. Bangladesh's globally recognised green factories and LEED-certified units offer a strong foundation in this regard.\nDespite remarkable progress over the last few decades, the industry is still largely dependent on exporting some basic cotton items. In recent years, the global fashion landscape has undergone a dramatic shift, with the reign of cotton fading and MMF taking center stage. While cotton initially fuelled the surge of the Bangladesh apparel market, that seems now to have reached its peak and its growth potential appears limited. This echoes the global trend in fibre demand, where the cotton-to-MMF ratio has shifted from 75:25 thirty years ago to a stark 25:75 today.\nThis strategic change underscores the growing significance of apparel made from artificial fabrics in the global market. In spite of the seismic shift in fibre demand, with non-cotton fibre accounting for 75 per cent of garments manufactured globally, Bangladesh still relies on cotton fibers to make 71 per cent of the country's export-oriented products. \nA recent study conducted by Wazir Advisors Pvt Ltd. suggests that the expansion of non-cotton garment exports holds immense potential for the country's economy. According to the study, conducted under the patronage of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), Bangladesh has the potential to increase its non-cotton garment exports from the current $15.6 billion to an impressive $46 billion annually by 2032, if entrepreneurs were to invest $18 billion to enhance manufacturing capacity and a fully integrated value chain. \nIf Bangladesh can act decisively to produce high-end products and bridge technological gaps to boost productivity and lower production costs, there is hope that the economy can not only withstand the impact of higher US tariffs but also emerge stronger.\naktuhin.fexpress@gmail.com\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

From the readymade garment industry to construction sites and ship breaking yards, workers are exposed to hazardous environments daily. Yet, systematic research and policy interventions to address these occupational risks are still scarce.\nThe lack of adequate OHS measures has direct consequences not only for individual workers but also for the nation's overall health and economic productivity. Work-related injuries, respiratory diseases, chemical exposures and ergonomic problems contribute to chronic illness, disability and loss of income for thousands of families. The public health burden is profound, but often overlooked in national health planning.\nBangladesh has made significant progress in areas like maternal and child health but occupational health research has not kept pace. Without data on workplace hazards, injury rates or long term health outcomes it is impossible to design evidence based interventions. Academic institutions with their research capacity can play a vital role in filling this gap. However, meaningful change requires active government involvement through policy reforms, enforcement of safety regulations, and funding for OHS programs.\nCollaborative initiatives between government bodies, universities, and industries can ensure that research findings are translated into practical safety measures. For example, implementing low cost protective equipment, training programs for workers and supervisors, and regular workplace audits could significantly reduce risks.\nThe lives and health of Bangladesh's workforce who drive the nation's economy cannot remain secondary. Strengthening occupational health and safety is not only a moral responsibility but also a strategic investment for sustainable development. By prioritizing research, fostering partnerships and enforcing safety standards, Bangladesh can protect its workers and set a precedent for worker centric development in South Asia.\nDr. Md Rifat Al Mazid Bhuiyan \nPost Graduate Fellow,\nDpt. of Community Medicine, \nRajshahi Medical College \nrifatalmazid@gmail.com\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The unrest involved clashes, crude bomb explosions, arson attacks, and assaults. Why did law and order deteriorate in Gopalganj? Why did the district administration fail to take adequate security measures to prevent the violence?\nOur concern is that such an incident, like that in Gopalganj, could occur in any part of the country if the administration remains indifferent to the activities of Bangladesh Awami League supporters and its affiliated wings. The NCP must also remain cautious about the resurgence of defeated forces. Otherwise, they risk being targeted and undergoing further suffering.\nAt present, the NCP's nationwide rallies faced disruption by miscreants and activists linked to a banned political party. All political parties, including the BNP, should reflect on the spirit of the students' martyrdom during times of unrest. We expect all political parties to rise above their differences and join hands to counter all ill motives and safeguard democracy.\nAs the national election approaches, the risk of an aggravated political situation cannot be overlooked or taken lightly. The government must treat this issue with the seriousness it deserves. We must stay vigilant against the malicious intent of those seeking to destabilise the country.\nAbu Taher\nKawran Bazar, Dhaka\nabutaher011@gmail.com\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
