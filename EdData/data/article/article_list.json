State Chief Minister M.K. Stalin has convened a meeting of legislature party leaders on April 9 to strategise the next move. With the admission season approaching, the development is bound to cause uncertainty and make medical aspirants anxious. Exemption from NEET now remains an inconclusive chapter in the State\u2019s decade-old policy discourse. No other State effort to legislate against a central mandate has been so protracted and unpredictable. In September 2017, two anti-NEET Bills met with a similar fate in Rashtrapati Bhavan. Four years later, the ruling DMK \u2014 having made NEET exemption a central electoral promise \u2014 passed the Bill in the Assembly based on the recommendations of the Justice A.K. Rajan Committee. Instead of forwarding it for presidential assent, Governor R.N. Ravi returned it to the House after five months. In a historic first, the Assembly unanimously re-adopted the Bill and sent it back to him; the Governor subsequently forwarded it to the President. Last week, Mr. Stalin informed the Assembly that assent had been denied, without specifying when Rashtrapati Bhavan had communicated the decision.This delay in the matter attaining finality is concerning as students have been left facing a state of perpetual uncertainty. The State remains firm in its policy of conducting admission for government quota medical seats based on the Class 12 Board examination scores. Early on, the Ministry of Home Affairs had asked \u201cwhether the Bill endangered the sovereignty, unity and integrity of the nation\u201d to which the AYUSH Ministry responded affirmatively. The framers of the Constitution had incorporated Article 254 (2) empowering the President to grant assent to Bills repugnant to central laws on Concurrent List matters. NEET has been consistently upheld by the Supreme Court of India too. The President is under no obligation to give assent, although the Bill reflects the collective will of Tamil Nadu\u2019s legislature: it was passed unanimously. True, NEET is neither foolproof nor an absolute measure of academic competency, but Tamil Nadu\u2019s legal options are limited. The judiciary is unlikely to settle the issue with any urgency. The State must prepare for a legal struggle, and in the interim, coach students to face NEET with confidence.

        "full_article": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to Sri Lanka, (April 4-6), his first after 2019, demonstrated, beyond optics, the close ties between the two countries. Colombo, under the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP)-led National People\u2019s Power (NPP) regime, is serious about improving relations with New Delhi. This was evident from the conferment of its highest honour for foreign leaders on Mr. Modi and a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on defence cooperation, billed as the first of its kind in bilateral ties. The JVP\u2019s ascension to power, following Anura Kumara Dissanayake\u2019s victory in the presidential poll in September 2024, and the NPP\u2019s resounding parliamentary election victory two months later, gave room to the perception that there would be a strictly formal, if not cold, relationship with India, given the JVP\u2019s anti-India posture of the past. There was also apprehension that Colombo might not be sensitive to New Delhi\u2019s security concerns. However, to be fair to him, Mr. Dissanayake reiterated his country\u2019s long-standing position that Sri Lanka would not permit its territory to be used against India\u2019s security and regional stability. Mr. Modi captured the rationale behind the MoU by saying that \u201cthe security of both countries is interconnected and co-dependent\u201d. Even though the MoU may have formalised certain arrangements in the area of defence, bilaterally, it is up to the NPP regime to establish that Sri Lanka means business in defence cooperation. But still, Sri Lanka is sure to be conscious that an understanding in 1987 not to let Trincomalee or any other Sri Lankan port be used for military purposes by a third country against India has not helped dispel India\u2019s concerns.On the vexatious fishermen\u2019s issue \u2014 one of importance to Tamil Nadu \u2014 it was a good sign that there were detailed discussions. But Mr. Modi\u2019s visit should trigger a full-fledged discussion between the fishing communities of the two countries, and one that is overseen by government officials. Recently, fishers on either side of the Palk Bay met and exchanged their views. If this meeting is to have some meaning, it should be followed up with another round of talks. A flexible approach will help create a lasting solution. Another significant outcome of the visit is that Tamil parties, in their meeting with Mr. Modi, conveyed the point that they recognised the significance of the Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987 in pursuit of achieving a political settlement for the Tamils and sought India\u2019s \u201clegitimate involvement\u201d. There has been criticism even in Sri Lanka that many of the parties had not fully supported the Accord, which paved the way for the establishment of provincial councils as a measure of devolution. New Delhi, which can provide liberal economic aid for the war-torn Northern and Eastern provinces, should play the role of a dispassionate observer and urge every stakeholder to pursue democratic means to arrive at a consensus.

        "full_article": "By B Purushartha\nThe idea of Ram is unparalleled in its character, contribution, and impact. Ram has been understood in multiple ways. For many, Ram is a historical man, but for some, Ram means good qualities, and the Ram-Ravan war is an inner war between good and evil.\nRam is so ingrained in Indian life and culture that we all accept him. He is ishtde vfor believers of a personal god (like Tulasi) but also dear to believers of an impersonal god (like Kabir). Ram-Rajya is synonymous with the ideal rule, and Ram-Baan with the infallible tool. \u2018Hey Ram\u2019 is the mostused sigh of the oppressed. He is an ideal son, brother and friend. While questions are raised about Ram as a husband, Ram and Sita are considered to be the perfect couple. In the Hindi belt, majority of marriage songs are based on Ram. Ram is a common name for many people, and Ram-Ram is a standard greeting in rural and semi-rural setups. Ram is such an integral part of our daily life that our everyday discourse cannot be without using the word \u2018ram\u2019.\nRam is not limited to elite class but worshipped by innumerable deen-dukhi people, including those outside brahmanical order: \u201cJo gati jog birag jatan kari nahin pavat muni jnani/So gati det gidh Shabri kahan prabhu bahut jiya jani\u201d \u2013 Ram easily gives that to the downtrodden which is unattainable by high priests. His popularity cutting across caste, creed, religion and geographical boundaries is a puzzle for many who wish to see India through a narrow lens.\nBut how did Ram attain such status and importance? Not just because he is an avatar. Ram is in a different league. This importance comes from the sacrifice and progressive outlook exemplified by him. Ram\u2019s sacrifice is unparalleled, and tapasya is long and painful. Despite being worthy and powerful, he shuns the kingdom for his father\u2019s wish. Being truthful to his vow, he never took comfort from royal patronage during vanvaas. He accepted everyone equally and empowered them. Ram led people to change the world.\nMany felt sorry for Ahilya, but only Ram worked for her social reacceptance. Only Ram wept for his wife. For setting the new maryada, he fought with the high and mighty Ravan, Indra, Jayant and Bali. Ram\u2019s fight was not only for his wife, but it was for the oppressed. He avowed in Atri Muni Ashram to rid the world of oppressors.\nWhile many cultures and civilisations assign the law-giving role to the wealthy and powerful, India assigns this role to the wise and tapasvi, who are beyond material pursuits. Ram is the ideal person tailor-made for this role, and he ensures that he does so while remaining a lifelong tapasvi \u2013 Ram tapasvi raja. That is why Allama Iqbal writes: \u201cHai Ram ke wajood pe Hindostan ko naaz/Ahl-e-nazar samajhte hain is ko Imam-e-Hind\u201d \u2013 India is proud of Ram, wise consider him spiritual guide of India.\nThe writer is joint secretary, DEA, Ministry of Finance, GOI.

It is possible that these protests will fade out, but it is equally possible that they will linger on like the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act.\nProtesters say this legislation is unconstitutional since it tinkers with the rights guaranteed under Article 26 of the Constitution, which gives any religious group or denomination the right to \u201cestablish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes; to manage its own affairs in matters of religion; to own and acquire movable and immovable property; and to administer such property in accordance with law.\u201d\n\nRead full story on TOI+\n\n",

        "full_article": "Will India or Vietnam make the best of an iconic American company\u2019s supply chain woes?\nBloodbath. For US stock after stock, that was the commonest fate on Liberation Day. Apple, the world\u2019s most valuable company, saw its shares slide 16% over Thursday and Friday. The April 2 tariffs have it in a pincer grip. China, which still assembles about 80% of the about 220mn iPhones sold in a year, has been hit with a 54% tariff. Analysts say this could mean a whopping 40% rise in iPhone prices. They are still lifting their jaws off the ground after watching Trump knocking out American icons like this. Apple has to deal with this blow in a flattening smartphone market. In its woes is the story of all businesses scrambling to rejig their global supply chain in the stormy new tariffverse.\nAs TOI reported yesterday, the company has already made \u201cunusually high\u201d number of shipments to US, from factories in India and China. So it may be able to hold off a retail price hike for a bit. India, which assembles around 15% of iPhones, has been hit with a 26% tariff. This is lower than China\u2019s but way more than companies planned for when they started diversifying here, impelled by Trump\u2019s first term and then by Covid. India, however, saw limited benefits from this China Plus strategy compared to countries like Vietnam. Factors ranging from simplifying tax laws to proactively signing FTAs helped the others pull ahead of us in expanding their export shares. This time around, the stakes are even higher. China\u2019s now thrown retaliatory tariffs into the ring. \u201cThey panicked \u2013 the one thing they cannot afford to do,\u201d Trump said. But our columnist today suggests that Washington will not be engaging in tariff negotiations with China anyway.\n\nBetween them things are bound to get worse. Other countries hope to get a happier hearing. Vietnam, hit with a 49% tariff, has talked to Trump already, offering to pull down its own tariff wall altogether in exchange for US softening. Vietnam has a $123.46bn trade surplus with US, compared to India\u2019s $45.66bn. They will both do what it takes to benefit from the strategic decoupling of US from China. If the April 2 tariffs stay sticky, it should be advantage India. But the ifs are infinite. One thing that\u2019s certain is that any smartphone manufacturing that moves to US is less likely to be done by Americans \u2013 than by their robots.\n\n",
