Despite claims of progress, with over 11% of the estimated electorate submitting forms, conflicting statements from the ECI highlight deep-seated issues. Initially, the CEO, Bihar, through advertisements, suggested a lenient approach towards electors who did not have the stipulated 11 documents. They were told that they could submit enumeration forms to booth-level officers and provide documents later, or even get verified without mandatory documents, with verification through local investigations by Electoral Registration Officers. However, the CEC clarified that earlier orders mandating document submission by July 25, 2025, stand, with a claims and objections period from August 1 to September 1 for those who fail to comply. This shift in stance and reliance on local-level investigations for verification present inherent problems. Leaving verification to the discretion of local electoral officers increases the possibility of misuse and bias. Such an ad hoc approach risks wrongful inclusions or exclusions, undermining the integrity of the electoral roll.Instead, the ECI should adopt a more pragmatic and robust approach by accepting more universally available identity documents such as Aadhaar, ration cards, and MGNREGA job cards. The ubiquity of Aadhaar, and its mandatory requirement for numerous government services, makes it an ideal proof of identity. Similarly, ration cards and MGNREGA job cards are widely held, particularly among agrarian populations, as they are central to India\u2019s welfare initiatives. Bihar\u2019s historical challenges in birth registration, school enrolment, and broader documentation mean that a significant number of genuine electors may lack any of the 11 indicative documents. The onus is on the state and its institutions, including the ECI, to facilitate their participation. The current rigid documentary requirements place an undue burden on voters, especially the marginalised and underprivileged, who already face significant hurdles in engaging with bureaucracy, and risks widespread disenfranchisement. The current Bihar exercise seems to be treating every voter as a potential non-citizen unless proven otherwise. To uphold the principle of universal adult franchise and prevent large-scale exclusion, the ECI must urgently reconsider its SIR even as the Supreme Court is due to hear petitions challenging this exercise. The ECI should immediately broaden the acceptable forms of identification, ensuring that all eligible citizens have the opportunity to exercise their constitutional right to vote.\r Published - July 08, 2025 12:20 am IST\n                          Read  Comments \n                Copy link  \n                        \n            \n                    Email     \n                                \n                \n                Facebook   \n                        \n            \n                Twitter    \n                        \n            \n                Telegram     \n                        \n            \n                LinkedIn     \n                        \n            \n                WhatsApp\n                \n                        \n            \n                Reddit      \n                        \n            READ LATER\n                    Remove     \n                \n                SEE ALL         \n                PRINT\n            Related Topics\n        \n                        Election Commission of India\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Bihar\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        voting\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Aadhaar\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Bihar Assembly Elections 2025\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        judiciary (system of justice)\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        constitution\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        welfare",

        "full_article": "With two cases of Nipah virus detected in Kerala \u2014 including one fatality owing to the infection \u2014 the attention is rightfully, once again, on a preventable infectious disease that could leave havoc in its trail. An adolescent girl from Malappuram succumbed to the virus on July 1, and a 38-year-old woman from Palakkad is battling for life in the hospital. In the big picture, as many as 425 people who are in the contact lists of the two Nipah-infected persons in three districts in Kerala have been identified and are under surveillance. Of these, 228 are from Malappuram district, where Patient Zero was identified this time, 110 in Palakkad and 87 in Kozhikode. In Palakkad, one contact is being treated in isolation, while 12 people are currently undergoing treatment in Malappuram \u2014 five of them are in the intensive care unit. One of them tested negative for the infection, and the results for the others are awaited. Over 140 of those on the contact list are said to be health workers. While the health machinery in Kerala is engaged in tracing the original source of the infection, it is also tasked, particularly in the three districts of Malappuram, Palakkad and Kozhikode, to trace contacts, isolate them to prevent further spread, contain infection and treat all those who show symptoms. India has recorded several outbreaks of the virus since 2001, a year when 45 of the 66 people infected died in West Bengal. In 2018, it surged in Kerala, with 17 of the 19 cases with laboratory-confirmed Nipah infection dying without responding to treatment. Kerala continues to report outbreaks regularly since then.What renders even a single case of significant concern to get the entire health-care machinery in a tizzy? Nipah is a transmissible viral infection with a high mortality rate, ranging between 40% and 75%, which implies that if the infection spreads, then, a number of people are likely to die. Future research might add an effective tool to the armamentarium to effectively treat Nipah infections without mortality, but as of now, the course of action is vested only in prevention and awareness generation. Nipah is transmitted by fruit bats which are the natural reservoirs of the virus. It is suspected that consuming contaminated fruits, bitten or licked by bats, may play a role in spreading the virus. It is also equally important to cast a watchful eye on climate change-related factors, particularly anthropogenic activity that is destroying natural habitats, and initiate a robust One Health programme that will weigh not just Nipah but also other pathogens that are capable of zoonotic spillover, transitioning from animals to humans and causing great harm.\r Published - July 08, 2025 12:10 am IST\n                          Read  Comments \n                Copy link  \n                        \n            \n                    Email     \n                                \n                \n                Facebook   \n                        \n            \n                Twitter    \n                        \n            \n                Telegram     \n                        \n            \n                LinkedIn     \n                        \n            \n                WhatsApp\n                \n                        \n            \n                Reddit      \n                        \n            READ LATER\n                    Remove     \n                \n                SEE ALL         \n                PRINT\n            Related Topics\n        \n                        Nipah Virus\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Kerala\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        health\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        healthcare policy\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        viral diseases\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        zoology (education)",

        "full_article": "BMC polls made Uddhav team up with bro Raj. He may not recover politically if he fails\u00a0\u00a0\nUBT Sena\u2019s Uddhav Thackeray, a practitioner of fluid politics, joining hands with MNS boss cousin Raj, a far-right hardline Marathi-Maratha politician, is unsurprising \u2013 the bros want to win elections to India\u2019s richest civic body, BMC. Shiv Sena has won BMC polls since 1985, barring 1992-1996. Raj broke away in 2005 after Uddhav inherited the party. Shiv Sena split in 2022 \u2013 Eknath Shinde toppled Uddhav govt and walked away with CMship, sainiks, party and symbol. Cut to the present: MNS has zero electoral relevance, Uddhav is floundering. After Lok Sabha and state polls, elections to BMC \u2013 the jewel in Sena\u2019s crown \u2013 will be Uddhav\u2019s third test. He has struggled to articulate his idea of a more inclusive Sena within the secular camp. When he resigned his post ahead of a floor test, it was a principled stand for a politician. It however cost him a potential return to office in the Supreme Court case that followed. Uddhav won the people\u2019s sympathy, sweeping LS polls, only to come a cropper in state elections.\nMahayuti (BJP+Shinde Sena) has held strong as a unit. UBT Sena long announced it wouldn\u2019t contest BMC polls as part of MVA. In tying up with MNS, Uddhav has turned another corner. Is there a meeting ground? If anything, it was Raj who raised eyebrows. He created an opening for a patch-up when he criticised Centre\u2019s reaction to Pahalgam attack. MNS brings sainiks, UBT Sena brings Uddhav. Will it be enough? In 2021-2022, OBC quota within BMC was a contentious issue \u2013 in 2021, under Uddhav, delimitation increased the number of wards from 227 to 236. Shinde scrapped that in Aug 2022. As the process for the election gets underway, it\u2019s such issues that will influence outcomes. The stakes are high for both Shinde Sena-BJP and UBT Sena-MNS. But for Uddhav personally, a loss can be hard to recover from. In the last BMC polls in 2017, undivided Shiv Sena won 84 seats, junior ally BJP 82. No one got a majority in the 227-seat BMC. Sena retained mayor\u2019s post. But eight years on, BJP\u2019s the Big Bro, and CM Fadnavis is aggressively if quietly calling the shots.\n\n",

Unlike phoren log who rent out their kids\u2019 rooms the minute they leave for college, we keep everything intact. Barbie posters and Pokemon cards, the sheets with strawberry or football prints on them. While the kid is away, we peep in to sigh and sing sad songs.\nNow the tables have turned. Children post-studies come and plonk themselves in their old bedrooms, staying out all night, waking up late, harking back to their monosyllabic adolescent selves. You suspect they are too lazy to do their own laundry; they say it\u2019s because they are deep in thought about what to do next. So terrified are they of doing the wrong thing, they\u2019d rather do nothing at all. The children are home, and have no plans to move out! They are neither interested in helping around the house nor in finding a job, preserving their energy for some mysterious event in the future.\u00a0\nIt is the young who now get to lament over the empty nest once the old are gone \u2013 or settled into old-age homes. After studying medicine or architecture they spend their time meeting other friends who are sitting at home just like them because, you know, they don\u2019t think medicine or architecture is for them. Unlike the previous generations, who write poetry and paint sunsets only as geriatrics because they spent their prime in govt jobs with pensions just as their ancestors wanted, no parent today dares to tell anyone what to study. Replacing caning with befriending of children was an error, say some historians \u2013 a tad late.\nGood news is we won\u2019t be grandmas. Bad news is this child-free generation will never know how much we suffered bringing them up. There is going to be no apology from contrite progeny while handling their own cranky progeny. They are also sure they don\u2019t want to marry \u2013 this isn\u2019t to be closely questioned as they may cite their own parents\u2019 alliance for their anti-marriage stance. Everything you remember as character-building is a traumatic memory for them; it is between them and their therapist. You may be thinking, hurrah, I don\u2019t have to save for their wedding. But you do have to save for your own funeral.\n\n",

Denmark is removing all letter boxes because the volume of personal mail has fallen 90% since 2000. UK\u2019s 500-year-old Royal Mail was sold to a Czech billionaire last year, because it\u2019s not popular anymore. From a peak of 20bn letters per year in 2004, it came down to 7bn in 2024. US Postal Service lost $9.5bn last year, up from $6.5bn in 2023. With 1.65L post offices, India Post is the largest mail carrier in the world, and its losses aren\u2019t insignificant either. But scrapping it is not an option as 90% of post offices serve rural locations, and remote or tribal areas.\u00a0\nGovt has been trying to boost revenue by turning India Post into a logistics firm \u2013 delivering Amazon packages in remote areas, for example. But monetising the larger post offices, especially the 15,823 in urban areas, could also improve finances. As communications minister Jyotiraditya Scindia told TOI in an interview: \u201cYou can have the post office on the ground floor and build the whole building and lease out space.\u201d It\u2019s a timely idea, not only for the department but also private businesses and institutions scouting for leasable premises in India\u2019s fast-growing cities. As Scindia said, India Post is already examining its paperwork to identify post offices that could be developed first, and other govt departments should follow its lead.\nGOI is the largest landowner in India, possessing some 15,500 sq km \u2013 more than 10 times the area of Delhi. Indian Railways alone owns at least 4,900 sq km of land. The defence ministry reportedly owns about 50% more. And there are dozens of other departments with large landholdings. Most of this land cannot be commercially developed, of course, but if even 1% can, we\u2019re talking 155 sq km \u2013 a quarter of Mumbai. Niti Aayog has pointed out that India\u2019s public sector is sitting on an inventory of \u201cunderutilised land assets\u201d. Consider that railways has leased out only 88 sq km or less than 2% of its land bank for passenger and cargo facilities, and commercial development. Niti\u2019s advice, under the National Monetisation Pipeline, is to \u201cown, hold, manage and monetise\u201d land and building assets of GOI-owned public sector enterprises. This strategy can not only trim losses, but also help improve passenger experience in trains and stations, and ensure India\u2019s letter boxes don\u2019t go the way of the pay phone.\n\n",

        "full_article": "\n / EDITORIAL\n \n       July 08, 2025 00:00:00  \nMuch of the country's economic haemorrhage owes to a gargantuan size of non-performing loans (NPLs). Banks that extended or were made to sanction such loans have bled white and would have collapsed long ago but for the injection of cash by the central bank in order to keep them afloat. However the overall liquidity crisis suffered by the banking sector including non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) was due to siphoning off the borrowed money abroad instead of investing in the stated productive sectors. The interim government's effort to bring back the laundered money amounting, according to experts, to Tk 1.0 trillion has failed because governments and various agencies of the destination countries did not cooperate in repatriation of the money stashed away in their banks. So the next course of action was to salvage the situation as much as possible by using both persuasive and coercive methods. \nThe loan-recovery committee formed by the Bangladesh Bank (BB) has made notable progress in solving the problem of default loans. It has already settled some 60 cases involving Tk 3.0 billion. The details of how each specific case was settled are not known but the broad rules governing the process have been made public. Some defaulters were allowed loan-rescheduling opportunity for the last time with a guarantee of repayment, others were granted an extension of loan-repayment period and still others, who opted for a business-exit plan, interest waiver in favour of repayment of the principal amount of loans. The 'guarantee of repayment' clause sounds good but has this been backed by a foolproof mechanism for repayment of the loans in instalment? The defaulters have a long history of adopting such a ploy to defer repayment. They are unlikely to let go any opportunity to abuse the agreement. So, it would be in the fairness of the fresh arrangement to use their existing assets as the collateral. They may buy time until the national election when the equation may once again shift in their favour. \nClearly, settlement of this order is impossible without concessions. But even if a good portion of the embezzled money and NPLs can be recovered through some concessions, the exercise is better than leaving the matter unattended. The positive vibe generated in case of the 60 cases settled seems to have encouraged some biggies known for their massive default culture to show their willingness for such mediated settlements. Reportedly, the committee has received more than 1,200 applications from companies and corporate houses including some large conglomerates. If they are sincere in striking workable and effective deals, the country's banking sector and the economy stand a chance of turning around.\nThis is certainly an opportunity for the erring big business houses to mend their ways. They can revive business fortune and restore confidence if they go by the respective letter of the rescheduling agreements. In this case, the most outstanding factor the loan-settling committee has emphasised is the verification of repayment capability of the defaulted companies. So, the committee has made recommendation for auditing those business houses' annual revenue earnings by reputed international auditors. Well, if the companies pass the test, they will qualify for the committee-determined ways of repayment of their loans. If everything goes well, at least some semblance of streamlining banking operation and economic order can be restored.\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

A plate of steaming rice with mustard Hilsa curry has long been a symbol of Bengali culinary pride. Yet, today, the same Hilsa that once swam abundantly in our rivers is becoming increasingly scarce, even during the peak fishing season. This scarcity is not only a matter of food supply or economy -- it is a national concern demanding immediate attention, scientific scrutiny, and a strong political will to address duly.\nDespite being in the heart of the Hilsa season, the fish is notably absent from the markets. Following a two-month government-imposed fishing ban, it was expected that shoals of Hilsa would once again grace the rivers and coasts of Bangladesh. That optimism, however, has quickly dissolved. Fishermen from major Hilsa-producing zones like Bhola, Pirojpur, and Patharghata are returning with nearly empty nets. Once these waters teemed with life; now, they yield only disappointment and economic despair.\nThese fishermen, who once brought in baskets brimming with Hilsa, now often return with as few as four to five fish after a full day of labor. The traditional livelihood of thousands is under threat. The initial hope that lack of rainfall might be the sole cause has given way to deeper fears. Conversations with local communities and experts reveal that this is not a cyclical phenomenon; it is a systemic breakdown caused by climate, environmental mismanagement, and regulatory gaps.\nAccording to the Department of Fisheries, the ongoing crisis is closely tied to climate change and rising temperatures. Hilsas are deep-water fish and tend to avoid surface water when temperatures soar above 30\u00b0C. This year, with much of Bangladesh enduring temperatures beyond 36\u00b0C, the Hilsa simply stayed hidden in the cooler depths, disrupting traditional fishing cycles. The combination of less rainfall and reduced river flow has further reduced the freshwater surge into the rivers -- a key trigger for Hilsa migration and breeding.\nCompounding this problem is the gradual loss of river depth. Shoals and sandbars (locally called chars) have choked many of the major estuaries, particularly in the Barisal region which is home to seven major river mouths. Once the crucial gateways through which Hilsa would swim upstream, these estuaries are now being blocked by sedimentation and unregulated dredging.\nThe ecological disruption is worsened by indiscriminate industrial activities, especially around sensitive coastal areas. For instance, the coal-based power plant in Taltali, Barguna, has severely affected the Baleshwar, Bishkhali, and Payra rivers. The plant's construction required massive sand extraction, which destabilized the riverbeds and disrupted the delicate ecosystem of the region. Similar damage has been caused by the Payra power plant in the Buragauranga and Agunmukha river basins.\nThese power plants not only cause environmental degradation but also affect aquatic life through vibrations from heavy machinery and coal-carrying ships. When key migration and spawning routes are blocked or disturbed, Hilsa cannot complete their life cycle, resulting in declining catches.\nAnother striking issue is the lack of coordination between regional countries sharing the same ecosystem. In India, Hilsa breeding season is designated from mid-April to mid-June. However, in Bangladesh, it officially begins in mid-June and lasts until the end of August. Since both countries share the same maritime zones, such discrepancy is scientifically flawed and administratively dangerous. During Bangladesh's fishing ban, thousands of Indian trawlers are reported to enter Bangladeshi waters illegally, catching fish at a time when Bangladeshi fishermen are grounded. This not only undermines conservation efforts but also creates a serious economic imbalance.\nOne of the gravest threats to Hilsa stocks is the unchecked fishing of juvenile Hilsa, known locally as jatka. Despite the government's initiatives and regulations to prevent jatka harvesting, these baby fish are being sold openly in market under the misleading name \"chapila.\" Millions of these juvenile Hilsa are being consumed before they can breed, severely hampering the natural regeneration cycle of the species. The authorities appear to be either under-resourced or unwilling to enforce the laws strictly.\nMore alarmingly, fishermen report the growing use of toxic chemicals to attract and catch fish in large quantities. This technique lures fish in bulk but kills them indiscriminately -- juveniles, adults, and even non-target species. Additionally, the use of destructive gear such as Chinese gill nets and stake nets is practically decimating Hilsa population.\nHilsa is not just a fish -- it is an economic pillar. The fish contributes over 1 per cent to the national GDP. From FY 2008-09, when Hilsa production stood at 299,000 metric tons, it climbed to 571,000 metric tons in FY 2022-23 -- an 83 per cent increase over 12 years. These gains were made possible through targeted government initiatives, including raising food aid (VGF) to fishermen during the off-season and enforcing seasonal bans.\nIn 2016, Hilsa received Geographical Indication (GI) status as a Bangladeshi product -- international recognition of its uniqueness and value. Yet all this progress is at risk if meaningful action is not taken immediately. Already, the price of Hilsa is rising due to limited supply. This not only burdens consumers but also widens the gap between demand and availability.\nSo, what needs to be done?\nFirst, the dredging of rivers must be prioritised. Without ensuring navigability, Hilsa cannot migrate to spawn, and production will keep falling. Restoring the natural routes of Hilsa is critical not only for the fish but for thousands of dependent fishing families.\nSecond, enforcement of fishing regulations must be strict and unrelenting. Illegal fishing nets must be banned, and those using chemicals and banned gear must face prosecution. Simultaneously, the black-market trade in jatka under the guise of chapila must be destroyed through surveillance and public awareness.\nThird, there must be regional policy harmonisation between Bangladesh and India. A joint management framework for Hilsa fishing and breeding seasons is essential for sustainable conservation.\nFourth, climate adaptation strategies must be integrated into fisheries policy. Research and forecasting tools should be improved to better understand temperature fluctuations, migration behaviors, and spawning timings.\nFinally, industrial development must not come at the cost of river ecosystems. Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) must be made mandatory and transparent for any riverine project. River safety, ecological balance, and fish migration corridors must be non-negotiable priorities in development planning.\nThe current scarcity of Hilsa in peak season is not a random natural event -- it is the product of policy failure, environmental mismanagement, and unchecked exploitation. Bangladesh must rise to the occasion to protect this national treasure before it's too late.\nWe owe it not only to our fishermen but to our future generations to ensure that Hilsa remains more than just a memory in our folklore, and continues to swim freely in the rivers that have nourished our land, people, and culture for centuries.\nmirmostafiz@yahoo.com\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The recommendations focus on identifying the segments in the global microchip industry's value chain that offer the best opportunities for Bangladesh to exploit and chart out a course of action, for instance, assessing the need gap, adopting a policy, building capacity and so on. Led by the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA), the 13-member NST has been drawn from a cross section of people including representatives from the government, the private sector, the academia and the Non-Resident Bangladeshi (NRB) community. Admittedly, the roadmap the NST submitted to the interim government's Chief Adviser (CA), Dr Muhammad Yunus, covers the critical areas that would require the government's support, especially in terms of its fiscal incentives and other policy-related backups. The plan to train thousands of IT engineers to power the growth of the domestic semiconductor industry is, of course, the first step. However, the training should involve hands-on experience, not just theoretical knowledge that Bangladesh's tech graduates usually learn from the technical institutes. That would necessitate the science and engineering graduates to have industry exposures through internship or other forms of work experience so they might be hired by the domestic tech companies or those in the global market. Alongside preparing the youths for jobs in the local and overseas tech markets, the government, as it spelt out in the NST's recommendations, would also be required to streamline its customs procedures and create dedicated zones in the high-tech parks to attract investors and encourage startups. These are some of the basic steps to develop country's semiconductor industry and turn Bangladesh into a player in global microchip market. There is no gainsaying the importance of these steps which have been described in the roadmap. These issues are also being talked about at various discussion forums since long. So after all the talks, it is now time to put those into concrete actions and ensure Bangladesh's entry into the multibillion dollar semiconductor market. According to an estimate, globally, total sales of the semiconductor sector reached USD627 billion in 2024 and is expected to rise to USD 697 billion by the end of 2025. Though the semiconductor industry is more than 75 years old, the digital revolution, also called the Third Industrial Revolution, that started with the invention of the Integrated Circuit (IC) or microchip in 1958, actually fuelled the growth of the semiconductor, or to be more to the point, the microchip industry. As no digital device can now be conceived of without microchips to run it, the industry has been expanding at breakneck speed so much so that the sector is forecast to grow into a trillion dollar one by 2030. Obviously, microchip sector is a highly competitive one. And that is more so because it has also become a theatre of competition between global tech powers, especially the USA and China. And the race is about taking the lead in the advancement of the AI industry. It is worth noting that AI's efficiency depends on development of the most advanced microchips, an area traditionally dominated by the US, the Netherlands, Taiwan and South Korea. China, too, has recently emerged as a big player in developing advanced microchips. To be frank, the domain of semiconductor has, of late, turned into a veritable hotspot of geopolitical rivalry.\nSince Bangladesh lacks the required physical infrastructure and trained manpower to start in a big way, the natural course of action it can take is to target areas in the semiconductor industry that are neither capital intensive, nor in need of high levels of skill. At present, Bangladesh's fledgling semiconductor industry caters mainly for designing service for the international microchip sector. Other areas including fabrication or making the chips, their assembly and testing require more advanced skills. But all the prospects are contingent upon uninterrupted supply of power and other utilities. So, before everything else, the government needs to get back to the basics.\nsfalim.ds@gmail.com\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

In this evolving landscape, Bangladesh finds itself at a unique crossroads, well-positioned to benefit from the redirection of manufacturing and investment away from China.\nSectors such as electronics, pharmaceuticals, agro-processing, and IT services offer particularly promising opportunities. With our strategic location, competitive labour costs, and a growing domestic market, Bangladesh is becoming increasingly attractive to global companies seeking alternative production hubs. The relocation of factories and capital inflows could generate considerable gains in employment, technology transfer, and overall economic growth.\nHowever, these prospects come with substantial challenges. Infrastructure bottlenecks, bureaucratic hurdles, regulatory uncertainty, and policy inconsistency continue to deter many potential investors. Added to this are weaknesses in port efficiency and logistics, and a lack of skilled labour. These issues require urgent attention if we are to truly capitalise on this moment.\nTo seize this opportunity, Bangladesh must undertake a series of targeted reforms. Bureaucratic processes need to be streamlined, ideally through digitisation and transparent systems. Regulatory frameworks should be simplified and made predictable to boost investor confidence. Furthermore, a strong emphasis must be placed on improving infrastructure, particularly in transportation and logistics, and developing a workforce equipped with industry-relevant skills.\nThe government should also consider establishing sector-specific special economic zones (SEZs) that offer comprehensive infrastructural facilities and attractive incentives for foreign investors. Strengthening diplomatic and trade missions to promote Bangladesh as a viable investment destination can also enhance our global positioning. Above all, aligning trade policies with global investor needs will be vital.\nBangladesh is standing on the brink of a transformative era. With strategic foresight and proactive reforms, we can turn global uncertainty into a powerful opportunity, ensuring long-term economic resilience, diversification, and competitiveness on the world stage.\nMd.
