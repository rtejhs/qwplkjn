It was United States President Donald Trump who first made the announcement of a \u201cceasefire\u201d between the two countries, and in further statements, American officials have said U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio were in close touch with leaders of both countries including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, \u2018helping\u201d them arrive at this understanding. The current flare-up was caused by the terrorist attack on tourists in Pahalgam on April 22. Pakistan has used terrorism as an unstated policy. By demonstrating that India can take overt military action against targets in Pakistan in the event of a terrorist attack, the Narendra Modi government has effectively announced a new security doctrine. Pakistan will not be allowed to hide behind deniability and continue to promote terrorism against innocent people. The Indian armed forces performed with stellar courage and professionalism, while civilians in Jammu and Kashmir paid a heavy price in terms of lives, peace and property. The people of Punjab also had to bear the brunt of the conflict. In the midst of the fire, the Modi government underscored a key principle of Indian identity that it is pluralist, multi-religious and democratic, and correctly identified Pakistan\u2019s strategy to create communal discord in the country.\rNow that a war has been avoided and the conflict been brought to a halt, the Modi government must take stock and share its learning with the people of India and their representatives. The Opposition Congress has demanded an all-party meeting chaired by Mr. Modi and a special session of Parliament. Several other political parties have supported the demand. The Centre can no longer remain silent on key questions regarding developments during the operations, the deaths and the losses. Truth cannot be allowed to be a casualty in war. Recent days have demonstrated significant new turns in geopolitics that have implications for India. China reportedly supported Pakistan\u2019s operations. U.S. involvement in the conflict between India and Pakistan is nothing new. But the Centre has to clarify the nature of the current involvement, as it raises concerns about the internationalisation of the Kashmir dispute. The recent days also saw competitive jingoism between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress, which is not helpful. The BJP, which is in power, is accountable and it cannot escape that by raising historical phantoms. For a country to be able to secure itself and prosper, there must be cool-headed thinking among its leaders, domestic political consensus and social harmony, and a respect for professional views as opposed to jingoistic slogans.\r Published - May 12, 2025 12:20 am IST\n                          Read  Comments \n                Copy link  \n                        \n            \n                    Email     \n                                \n                \n                Facebook   \n                        \n            \n                Twitter    \n                        \n            \n                Telegram     \n                        \n            \n                LinkedIn     \n                        \n            \n                WhatsApp\n                \n                        \n            \n                Reddit      \n                        \n            READ LATER\n                    Remove     \n                \n                SEE ALL         \n                PRINT\n            Related Topics\n        \n                        Operation Sindoor 2025\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        India\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Pakistan\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        USA\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        armed conflict\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Prime Minister Narendra Modi\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Pahalgam terror attack 2025\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Jammu and Kashmir\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Punjab\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Indian National Congress\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        China\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Bharatiya Janata Party\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        politics\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        social issue",

        "full_article": "The Supreme Court of India order on May 9, 2025, setting aside the Delhi High Court order directing the Wikimedia Foundation to take down a page on its Wikipedia Internet encyclopaedia, is notable for several reasons. In October 2024, a single judge of the High Court had issued the interim order after Wikipedia users floated a new page detailing the defamation case and a discussion forum in which some users commented adversely on the single judge\u2019s order, construing these actions to be in contempt. After a Division Bench upheld the order, the Foundation moved the Court. Subsequently, the Bench of Justices Abhay S. Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan observed that \u201c[e]very important issue needs to be vigorously debated by the people and the press, even if the issue of debate is sub judice before a court\u201d and that the High Court had overreacted to adverse comments of its take-down order in the forum. The Bench\u2019s order was limited to the Foundation\u2019s appeal over the legality of the take-down order, following on from a similar one in April to set aside an order to remove allegedly defamatory edits on ANI\u2019s Wikipedia page. Yet the order is also clear that the right to know is a basic right under Articles 19(1)(a) and 21, casting the case against the Foundation in a light that may have eluded the High Court. While discussing the presumption of contempt, Justices Oka and Bhuyan noted that the right to know controls the people\u2019s ability to participate in public development and to access justice.Since ANI\u2019s suit continues, the High Court may consider applying the value of the right to know to the question of the Foundation\u2019s intermediary status under the Information Technology Act. The Foundation only avails the technical infrastructure to Wikipedia users, who then operate according to a set of guidelines to maintain the encyclopaedia. The setup allows users to act independently even as the guidelines are clear that Wikipedia will only collect and organise information from other sources, and not develop new theses of its own. Thus, the Foundation caters to the people\u2019s right to know by protecting users against reprisals by the aggrieved powerful and by enhancing the quality of their contributions through the platform\u2019s democratic apparatus. The right to know and the right to freedom of expression should be upheld before the Supreme Court is involved in each case. As the Justices invoked former Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud quoting Jeremy Bentham to say: \u201cpublicity about courtroom proceedings \u2026 keeps the judge himself, while trying, under trial.\u201d\r Published - May 12, 2025 12:10 am IST\n                          Read  Comments \n                Copy link  \n                        \n            \n                    Email     \n                                \n                \n                Facebook   \n                        \n            \n                Twitter    \n                        \n            \n                Telegram     \n                        \n            \n                LinkedIn     \n                        \n            \n                WhatsApp\n                \n                        \n            \n                Reddit      \n                        \n            READ LATER\n                    Remove     \n                \n                SEE ALL         \n                PRINT\n            Related Topics\n        \n                        judiciary (system of justice)\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        online\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        internet\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        human rights\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        laws\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        democracy",

        "full_article": "He will deal with anyone, even Houthis & Hamas. But even he shouldn\u2019t equate India & Pakistan\u00a0\u00a0\nTrump took full credit for helping stop hostilities between India and Pakistan. US did parley with Indian and Pakistani leaders. But there are strong indications he may be overstating his and US role. But that\u2019s not holding him back. On his Truth Social platform he\u2019s said that he is \u201cvery proud of the strong and unwaveringly powerful leadership of India and Pakistan for having the strength, wisdom and fortitude\u2026 to stop the current aggression\u201d. He added, \u201cWhile not even discussed, I am going to increase trade, substantially, with both of these great Nations\u201d before finishing with \u201cGod Bless the leadership of India and Pakistan on a job well done!!!\u201d\nFour months into his second term, Trump\u2019s new approach to US foreign policy is now well-known. There are no untouchables. Deals can be done with anyone. That\u2019s how he has approached the Ukraine-Russia war, restarting direct diplomacy with Moscow. He\u2019s now done a deal with Houthis after bombing them. And there is chatter of a deal with Hamas that doesn\u2019t require it to disarm. Clearly, Trump is agnostic about the people he is looking to cut deals with. Even then, treating India and Pakistan as equals, given the latter\u2019s track record with terrorism, is puzzling and disconcerting.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPakistan has long been the epicentre of global terror. And this has harmed US. Osama bin Laden was sheltering in Pakistan. Pak-based Haqqani Network has killed many US soldiers. Pak-sponsored 26/11 terror attack in India had killed six Americans. The list goes on. So even for wheeling-dealing Trump, there should be some red lines. Pakistan has long run with the hare and hunted with the hounds, and also bankrupted itself. India has been a democracy, and is now, nearly the world\u2019s fourth largest economy. That\u2019s a difference the US president should recognise. \n\n",

        "full_article": "Op Sindoor did what it set out to, at minimal cost to country. GOI\u2019s verbal restraint is a sign of a mature power\u00a0\nRelief in Pakistan after Saturday\u2019s ceasefire was palpable when PM Shehbaz Sharif rushed to declare the pause a \u201chistoric victory\u201d. As expected, the propaganda war was about to hot up. But Indian officials held their volleys, displaying the same verbal restraint that distinguished foreign secretary Vikram Misri and his defence colleagues this past week. While a section of Indians no doubt disagrees \u2013 worried about the battle of narratives \u2013 this restraint should be seen as a sign of India\u2019s maturity.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs a major economy, and rising military power, India does not need to convey its strength with boastful words. Note how Air Marshal AK Bharti didn\u2019t gloat over the damage inflicted upon Pakistan at yesterday\u2019s presser: \u201cOur job is to hit the target, not to count the body bags.\u201d This policy of careful assessment, deliberate action, and measured statements befits India\u2019s global stature. Pakistan, meanwhile, lives off borrowings, and must delude itself to keep up morale.\nAs to the question, did Op Sindoor achieve its objectives, the answer is yes. Recall what India said after the 25-minute operation last Wednesday. It was a \u201cmeasured and non-escalatory, proportionate and responsible\u201d strike to dismantle terror infra. War wasn\u2019t a goal.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nYet another way to assess outcomes is to tot up losses. Some Indian lives were sadly lost in Pakistani shelling, but overall, India suffered almost no damage. Our air defences worked well. And when India decided to retaliate strongly, it punched craters in Pakistani air bases \u2013 notably Nur Khan air base not far from Pakistan\u2019s nuclear command centre.\u00a0\u00a0\nSome are disappointed that India agreed to halt operations when it had the upper hand, but consider that every conflict distracts from the primary goal of nation building. After achieving all objectives of Op Sindoor, and more, with minimal human and material costs, it was wise of India to disengage. Unlike Pakistan, we have far bigger stakes in our future.\nAbove all, post-Op Sindoor, Pakistan will have to weigh the costs of its proxy war carefully. India has made it clear that every terrorist act hereon will be regarded as an act of war. That doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ll launch a military operation every time, but we reserve the right to do so whenever we choose to.\nEvery military operation is an opportunity to assess strengths and weaknesses, and India will do so now. The idea that Op Sindoor was halted before achieving its objectives must be banished. Instead, attention must shift to catching the perpetrators of Pahalgam. Terrorists should know they have no place left to hide \u2013 not in India, not even in Pakistan. \n\n",

She couldn\u2019t go on the 2019 NASA mission because there weren\u2019t enough medium-size spacesuits; she\u2019d requested a size change after her previous outing. Looks like even the sky\u2019s not the limit for gendering. Bet some MCP, as in Mission Control Pig, had rolled his eyes and muttered, \u2018How much do American women want? Svetlana Savitskaya would have been blasted into Siberia instead of history if she\u2019d made any such fuss.

Fellow-sizee Belle rescued me.\nMyriad lemons are thrown at the U-5 team. Low life, we are constantly \u2018overlooked\u2019. My social demands as Bombay Times editor threw bonsai me among swaying palms of vertiginous models. When I had to pull up my growing boys, I had to first ask them to sit down. Now my teenstalk grandson sweeps the air like a searchlight and teases, \u2018Where are you, Ga?\u2019\nAge reconciled me to being longitudinally challenged; now the problem is latitudinal.

But the spectacle of a sponsor of terror getting bailouts from an international lender is truly jarring. IMF bailouts for Pakistan are akin to giving a delinquent teenager additional pocket money despite a history of irresponsible behaviour. It must stop for the sake of global security.\u00a0\nDespite an astonishing 24 IMF bailouts since 1958, Pakistan has little to show by way of reforms. Even noted Pakistani economist Kaiser Bengali has said that his country has been reduced to a pauper, taking loans to pay off loans. Any sensible country would have made its economy a priority. But Pakistan spends the money on defence, willingly gets into conflict situations, and fritters the rest away through corruption. Consider two points. According to SIPRI, Pakistan spent $10bn or 2.6% of its GDP on defence in 2024. This, despite Islamabad\u2019s external debt being over $130bn, and forex reserves just $15bn, good for only three months of imports. Pakistan\u2019s army is clearly siphoning off most of the country\u2019s money and bailout support. Yet, Islamabad this year proposes to further increase defence spending by 18%\u00a0\nSecond, for every Pakistani Rs 100 collected in taxes, trading and commercial imports businesses contribute just 60 paise. Unsurprisingly, a plethora of Pakistan\u2019s politicians fall in the latter category. In other words, Pak generals and politicians are looting the state. But if international lenders threaten to withhold financial support, Pakistan\u2019s leaders have perfected the art of negotiating with a gun to their head, effectively engaging in nuclear blackmail. It\u2019s time to call Pakistan\u2019s bluff. The generals at Rawalpindi GHQ and Pakistan\u2019s corrupt politicians have taken the world for a ride for far too long.\n\n",

        "full_article": "On late Saturday night, the interim government announced a ban on the activities of Awami League, including its online presence, under the Anti-Terrorism Act. The ban, we are told, will remain in place until the International Crimes Tribunal concludes the trial of the party and its leaders. This is a unique step. Following 15 years of repression and particularly its role during the July uprising, there is a widespread sense of public disgust towards the AL, which is clearly visible to all. Public outrage intensified when former President Abdul Hamid was recently permitted to leave the country for Thailand. This served as a trigger, prompting the government to impose the ban in a matter of days, despite having shown reluctance to do so in the previous 10 months. The key question now is: how will this decision impact our politics and future elections?\nLooking at historical examples globally, the banning of political parties is relatively rare. Even rarer is a ban that successfully achieves its intended objectives\u2014the banning of the Nazi Party, which played a central role in starting the Second World War, being a unique exception. In our own history, we have witnessed the banning of religion-based political parties after our independence. However, that ban was lifted under President Ziaur Rahman. Sheikh Hasina's AL government also banned Jamaat-e-Islami shortly before its fall from power. Even before that, in 2013, Jamaat was barred from contesting elections by a High Court ruling. That decision was repeatedly used by Hasina's AL government as a pretext to crack down on Jamaat's leaders and activists\u2014as well as on other dissidents falsely associated with Jamaat. But did that prevent Jamaat's survival and later emergence as a powerful political force?\nIt is a matter of fact that Sheikh Hasina and numerous leaders and activists of the AL have committed grave human rights violations. What is unfortunate is that, despite the passing of 10 months, we have not seen the government make significant headway in appropriately prosecuting the alleged criminals within the AL, starting from the very top. And looking at historical examples, both globally and locally, whether a blanket ban serves the purpose of properly dispensing justice remains questionable.\nIt is more than likely that the ban may drive many AL members to questionable activities, as we have seen previously with associates of some banned political parties. So, instead of taking the easy way out by simply banning the party, the government should focus on meeting the primary demand post-uprising: justice for the many atrocities perpetrated by AL members, through transparent and proper trials. We must learn from global, Asian, South Asian, and our own history about the results of banning a political party.\n",

        "full_article": "Rabindranath Tagore, whose genius touched nearly every branch of the arts and literature, left an indelible imprint on the world of drama\u2014not merely as a playwright, but as an actor, director, and visionary of the stage. His play Muktadhara, written over a century ago, stands as a luminous critique of self-interest-driven political ideologies. Living under the shadow of colonial rule, Tagore watched as the rise of machinery and technology reshaped the dreams and follies of both empire and nation. Strikingly, he not only foresaw the wounds humanity would inflict upon the climate, but also prophesied the devastating force of blind nationalism against the natural world. Historian Edward Thompson hailed Muktadhara as Tagore's finest prose drama, while Marjorie Sykes admired its rare, unflinching power in expressing his political vision.\nThe Story of Muktadhara\nMuktadhara tells the story of King Ranjit of Uttarkut, who, through the tireless efforts of the royal engineer Bibhuti over twenty-five years, constructed the mighty Muktadhara Dam, making the neighbouring region of Shibtarai dependent on Uttarkut for its water supply. Uttarkut sits in the upper basin of the Muktadhara spring's mountainous source, while Shibtarai lies below. When a new water crisis strikes and famine looms, the people of Shibtarai, led by the ascetic Dhananjay Bairagi, launch a satyagraha by refusing to pay taxes. Crown Prince Abhijit is dispatched to suppress the movement, but instead he is moved by the suffering of the people. When he reports this to the king, he is replaced by the king's oppressive brother-in-law, newly appointed governor.\nAbhijit later learns from his uncle that he is not of royal blood but was found and raised by the king, born near the very spring of Muktadhara. When ordered to use the dam as a weapon against Shibtarai, Abhijit refuses and pleads with Bibhuti to dismantle it. Yet Bibhuti, blinded by pride, refuses. In an act of defiance, Abhijit opens the passage, is imprisoned, and is branded a traitor. In the end, he releases the waters\u2014and is carried away with them.\nHow Muktadhara Was Written and Performed\nBetween May 1920 and July 1921, Rabindranath Tagore travelled extensively across Europe and the United States in the aftermath of World War I. Earlier, in 1916, he had visited Japan and America, where he delivered his famous lectures on nationalism, warning of the dangers of narrow national pride and its potential to devastate both societies and nature. Meanwhile, back home in Bengal, the Non-Cooperation Movement was gaining momentum. Although Tagore remained politically engaged\u2014often reflecting on events in his letters\u2014his creative output slowed as he focused on his educational project, Visva-Bharati.\nIt was during a brief stay at Selaidaha in Kushtia in late December 1921 that Tagore composed Muktadhara. After completing the play, he returned to Visva-Bharati, read it to the ashram community, made revisions, and initially considered naming it Path or Street. Eventually, it was published as Muktadhara. In February, he read it again at Gaganendranath Tagore's home in Calcutta. There, Tagore emphasised, \"This play should not be taken as an allegory. The movement that has deeply permeated the country today is not represented through metaphor\u2026 What has been especially portrayed is that clearing the path, opening the way for human unity, is the ultimate message of all civilisation.\"\nBiographer Prasanta Kumar Pal notes that Muktadhara was first published in Prabasi in Baishakh 1329 (1922), then as a standalone book later that year, funded by Prabasi editor Ramananda Chattopadhyay, who donated 3,731 copies to Visva-Bharati. Hoping to reach European audiences, Tagore translated the play as The Waterfall, published in The Modern Review in May 1922. Its critique of mechanisation likely resonated more with European readers, who were already grappling with industrialisation's effects, than with Indian audiences.\nHowever, as Abhijit Sen noted, The Waterfall received less attention than Red Oleanders, Tagore's English version of Raktakarabi(1924). Surprisingly, Tagore never saw Muktadhara or Raktakarabi staged during his lifetime. He had woven 14 songs into Muktadhara, blending music and dialogue seamlessly.\nInitially, Muktadhara received a lukewarm response. Though Tagore wrote to Ranu Adhikari about staging it, time constraints prevented this. It was first performed four years later by Presidency College students. In 1959, Bohurupee staged it under Shambhu Mitra, but it failed to connect. A 1996 revival by Kumar Roy and performances near the Farakka Barrage gave the play new life, especially among Narmada Bachao Andolan activists. In Bangladesh, Muktadhara remains part of Tagore's enduring dramatic legacy.\nDialogues in Muktadhara\n\nDrama is a concentrated effort to unite actors and audience by crafting a shared ambience\u2014through stage design, lighting, meaningful dialogue, and the director's vision. Among these, it is primarily dialogue that generates tension, nuance, and layered meaning for the audience. In Muktadhara, a striking example occurs when a teacher presents his students to the king during the public celebration of the dam. The scene offers a revealing glimpse into how ideology is transmitted\u2014even to the youngest citizens\u2014under the guise of education. The king engages the students in conversation, probing how deeply they have internalised the prevailing political rhetoric.\nKing: They all know, I suppose, what Bibhuti has done?\nStudents (jumping and clapping their hands): Yes, yes! He has stopped Shivtarai's drinking water!\nKing: And why did he do that?\nStudents: To make them smart!\nKing: And why should he make them smart?\nStudents: Because they are bad men.\nKing: How bad?\nStudents: Everybody knows it\u2014they are very bad, awfully bad!\nKing:\u00a0 But do you know why they are bad?\nTeacher: Of course they know, Maharaja. Now, you\u2014didn't you read it? Didn't you read it in your book?\n(whispers) Their religion is very bad.\nStudents: Yes, yes! Their religion is very bad.\nTeacher: And besides, they're not like us. Come now, speak up! (He points to his nose.)\nStudents: They haven't got high-ridged noses!\nTeacher: Right. And what has our professor taught us? What does a high-ridged nose mean?\nStudents: The greatness of our race!\nThis scene, with its satirical intensity, exposes how prejudice, hatred, and racial superiority are embedded into the minds of children through manipulated education\u2014something Rabindranath critiques with biting clarity.\nBibhuti, who spent 25 years building the dam, saw it as a triumph of human intelligence over nature: \"The gods gave them water. To me, they gave power. My dam was meant to prove intelligence, not to save a farmer's maize crop.\"\nKing Ranajit of Uttarakut faced criticism from his uncle, King Visvajit of Mohangarh, who questioned the dam's purpose and the worship of Bhairava, especially dedicating a day to celebrate a machine that blocked a sacred spring. Bhairava, after all, is also Shivtarai's deity.\nRanajit replied fiercely: \"To conquer our enemies. Bhairava is ours\u2014our victories are His. He reclaims his gift by piercing Shivtarai and offering it to Uttarakut.\"\nVisvajit shot back: \"That's not worship\u2014it's payment.\"\nThe most suspenseful event in the drama is the revelation that Abhijit is not the king's true son. Learning of his birth by the Muktadhara falls, this discovery shapes his final mission: to release the spring and clear the path.\nRanajit's temper flared when he suspected that it was Visvajit who had revealed to Abhijit the truth about his origins\u2014that he had been found beneath the falls of Muktadhara. Visvajit admitted as much and recounted a striking moment: \"I saw him (Abhijit) standing on the terrace, gazing towards Gouri's Peak. 'What do you see, brother?' I asked. 'I see roads,' he said, 'roads not yet built\u2014roads of the future that cross those forbidding passes, roads that will bring the distant near.' As I listened, I thought: 'Some vagrant mother bore him by the springs of Muktadhara, and who can keep him bound?' I could no longer keep silent. I said, 'Brother, from the moment of your birth, the Lord of the Hills welcomed you to the road. No conch-shell called you within doors.'\"\nRanajit now understood why Abhijit's loyalty had drifted from the royal house of Uttarakut. Abhijit had openly demonstrated his alienation by reopening the Nandi Pass\u2014a route that, once cleared, connected both Uttarakut and Shivtarai. But this very path to unity had been forcefully closed again with the construction of the dam.\nEnraged by what he saw as defiance and betrayal, Ranajit ordered King Visvajit to leave Uttarakut forever. In a symbolic reversal of allegiance and control, he exiled Visvajit and incarcerated Abhijit\u2014for daring to reopen the Nandi Pass to save the Shivtarai people from continual famine.\nIn response to the injustice imposed by Uttarakut, the people of Shivtarai express their resentment\u2014revealing not just resistance but also deep-seated stereotypes and disdain. Their conversation reflects how prejudice and misperception were embedded in the everyday discourse of common people, mirroring the same kind of hatred.\nFirst Shiv: What strange faces these Uttarakut fellows have! It's as if the Creator began shaping a lump of flesh but never finished the job.\nSecond Shiv: And those absurdly tight clothes\u2014have you ever seen anything like it?\nThird Shiv: They've wrapped themselves up like packages, afraid a piece of themselves might fall off.\nFirst Shiv: They're born to drudgery\u2014always loitering around markets and ferries.\nSecond Shiv: No culture at all. Their so-called scriptures\u2014what even is in them?\nFirst Shiv: Nothing! Absolutely nothing. And did you see their writing? Like a trail of white ants.\nSecond Shiv: Exactly! White ants\u2014they gnaw everything to pieces with their so-called 'culture.'\nThird Shiv: And then bury it all under their mounds.\nFirst Shiv: Yes\u2014killing our bodies with their weapons, and our minds with their books.\nSecond Shiv: They are steeped in sin. Our guru says even crossing their shadow is a pollution.\nThis dialogue powerfully illustrates how mutual hatred\u2014fuelled by distorted beliefs, cultural superiority, and predisposition\u2014pervades both sides. Rabindranath highlights how deeply these divisions are entrenched, affecting not only the common people but also institutional thinking, from everyday life to classroom instruction.\nCharacters in Muktadhara\nCritics have observed that the identity of Uttarakut is revealed through the tension between Bibhuti and Abhijit. While Bibhuti embodies the mechanical mind\u2014the triumph of machines\u2014Abhijit represents the human spirit that resists dehumanisation, merging the poet's soul with the rebel's courage. His rebellion is tragic because it is life itself, not just another lifeless force, that rises against the machinery of domination. As Pramath Nath Bishi noted, Bibhuti and Abhijit represent two realms\u2014the mechanical and the post-mechanical\u2014that together form Uttarakut's full identity. They are not opposites but complements, bound in relation.\nSimilarly, the soul of Shivtarai emerges through the interplay between Dhananjay Bairagi and the suffering masses\u2014the \"beaten ones.\" Dhananjay's duality shows in his call to resist violence with non-violence, while his human vulnerability responds with grief or anger. Just as Uttarakut fails to grasp Abhijit's message, Shivtarai cannot absorb Dhananjay's deeper moral vision. While Uttarakut rallies around nationalism, Shivtarai places blind faith in a heroic saviour.\nThe relationship between King Ranajit and Abhijit also carries tragic weight, reminiscent of Creon and Antigone. Ranajit, bound by duty, cannot understand Abhijit and ultimately imprisons him\u2014turning the rebel's death into both a political and deeply personal tragedy.\nEkla Cholo Re?\n\nThe dam not only made life in Shivtarai unbearable by blocking the natural flow of the spring, but it also cost the lives of many people from Uttarakut who were forced into labour to realise this grand vision. Every boy aged eighteen and above was seized to serve as part of the workforce behind this boastful monument, built to assert dominance over Shivtarai.\nOne of the most haunting figures in the drama is Sumon's mother, who appears repeatedly, seemingly losing her mental stability as she searches for her missing son\u2014taken away for the dam's construction and never heard from again. Yet Bibhuti remains unmoved, declaring, \"Their lives were not given in vain, and my dam is completed.\" They become martyrs to their own progress\u2014what we might now call martyrs for development. However, from the king to the common people, the lives of many like Sumon were ultimately regarded as expendable in the name of Uttarakut's national interest.\nIn Muktadhara, two distinct collective dispositions emerge. On one side, the people of Uttarakut turn vehemently against Prince Abhijit for opening the Nandi Pass, denouncing him as a traitor to the state. Their anger is so consuming that they demand to seize him from royal custody and subject him to an immediate trial\u2014bypassing both legal procedure and the authority of the king, whom they suspect may pardon him out of paternal affection.\nOn the other side, the people of Shivtarai are driven by a singular desire for revenge. They place blind faith in Dhananjay, their chosen leader, expecting him to deliver immediate relief from their suffering. This mirrors a familiar pattern: the uncritical worship of a messianic figure and total submission, which Dhananjay himself detests. Both groups, in their own ways, reveal how collective passion can overshadow justice, reason, and self-awareness.\nAmid this frenzy, only one woman dares to speak the truth: that the prince committed no crime by opening the pass.\nAfter 100 Years of Muktadhara\nRabindranath engaged deeply with the realities of both the colonised world and the so-called free nations of Europe, America, and Japan. Born and raised in the cosmopolitan city of Calcutta, he also spent extended periods in the rural heartlands of East Bengal. This dual exposure shaped his critical insight and sensitivity to the profound social, environmental, and ecological changes unfolding around him. In his travelogue Japan Jatri, based on his first visit to Japan in 1916, he wrote in his letters:\nThe cities in this world that are truly alive have been built through human compassion. Be it Delhi, Agra, or Kashi\u2014human joy has brought them into being. But the goddess of commerce is ruthless; beneath her feet, the lotus of beauty in the human mind-lake does not bloom. She does not look towards people\u2014she desires only commodities; the machine is her vehicle.\nWhen our ship was coming down the Ganges, we saw the shameless cruelty of commercial wealth along both banks of the river. It is because she holds no affection in her heart that she has been able to so easily destroy the beautiful riverside of Bengal's Ganges.\nNotably, in the play Muktadhara, we see the other side of the coin to the destruction of the environment and the river\u2014driven by the interests of a particular nation seeking to subjugate others by asserting supremacy through geographical positioning, aided by scientific knowledge and technology. This stands in contrast to the focus on commerce that Tagore reflected on in Japan Jatri.\nBeyond the crisis of nationalistic ideas, the contemporary debate between Rabindranath and Gandhi over machines and technology becomes crucial\u2014and even more relevant in today's world. The shadow of this debate is prominently reflected in the play. While Gandhi viewed the machine as inherently problematic, ultimately seeing it as a source of tyranny over both humans and nature, his position leaned towards the eradication of machines altogether.\nRabindranath, on the other hand, believed that science and technology should not be rejected irrationally. He acknowledged their dangers but maintained that their impact depended on the rationality and ethics with which humans employed them. However, in today's world, the line between rational and irrational use has become increasingly blurred.\nAs Ashis Nandy observed, \"Patriotism is sentimental; nationalism is an ideology,\" and Rabindranath composed over 200 poems imbued with the spirit of patriotism, consistently rejecting the ideological rigidity of nationalism\u2014a stance that also finds powerful expression in his symbolic drama Muktadhara.\nPriyam Pritim Paul is a researcher and journalist.\n",

        "full_article": "Renewable energy in Bangladesh is a bit like your overly ambitious cousin who swears they'll start waking up at 6:00 am, run 10 kilometres, and read Tolstoy before breakfast\u2014grand promises, minimal follow-through, and inevitably back to square one by the weekend. Every now and then, we're treated to a flashy announcement: a new solar megaproject here, a bold wind energy target there, all wrapped in glossy government statements and hashtags like #GreenBangladesh. We are now in 2025, and despite years of courtship with solar panels and flirtation with wind turbines, we're still stuck in a toxic relationship with fossil fuels\u2014cuddling up to imported coal and whispering sweet nothings to liquefied natural gas (LNG).\nLet's look at the reality behind the ribbon cuttings. Despite years of lofty commitments and climate conference pledges, renewable energy in Bangladesh accounts for only about 4.5 percent of total installed capacity, and more than 80 percent of that comes from solar. But even that number flatters to deceive. Most of it is from small, decentralised systems\u2014rooftop solar, solar home systems in villages\u2014not large-scale, grid-connected solar farms. The sun might shine relentlessly here, but our solar energy ambitions collapse faster than a flimsy Dhaka umbrella in July rain.\nWhy is the picture so bleak in a country that quite literally bakes under the sun and gets enough wind along the coast to power an Atif Aslam concert? Because our approach to renewable energy is equal parts chaotic and comical. Think of it as a gym subscription, enthusiastically bought, barely used, and always waiting for \"the first of next month.\" One minute we're promising 6,000 megawatts of renewable energy by 2025, and the next, we're cutting the power sector budget by 15 percent and quietly stalling the very policy reforms that would make those targets remotely achievable.\nLet's dissect the big announcement. The long-awaited draft of the Renewable Energy Policy (REP) 2025 was finally published in February, heralding the same old excitement, now with bigger numbers. It promises that by 2030, Bangladesh will generate 20 percent of its electricity\u20146,145 megawatts\u2014from renewables. By 2041, this will leap to 30 percent. It sounds impressive until you realise the whole projection is based on an inflated electricity demand estimate from the Integrated Energy and Power Master Plan (IEPMP). According to the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), a more realistic figure for 20 percent renewable electricity by 2030 would be around 5,600 megawatts, and just 10,500 megawatts for 30 percent by 2041. In other words, the government has taken some creative liberties with its math.\nLet's not forget that back in 2008, Bangladesh set a modest goal of reaching 10 percent renewable electricity by 2020. That deadline ghosted us like a flaky Hinge match. Fast forward to today, and we're barely scraping five percent. Yet we are now expected to believe we'll quadruple that number in just six years. To put things in perspective, even China, the undisputed heavyweight champion of renewables, is targeting 25 percent non-fossil energy by 2030. Bangladesh, which has neither China's resources, infrastructure, nor investment climate, thinks it can match that. Bold. Delusional, but bold.\nWhat really makes the draft policy shine, in the same way cheap plastic does under bad lighting, is its complete avoidance of any fossil fuel phase-out plan. Countries like the United Kingdom and Germany have legally committed to phasing out coal. Bangladesh? We're still busy signing new fossil fuel deals like it's 1999. The draft throws around the phrase \"green energy\" with such abandon you'd think it means anything remotely not-black\u2014bioenergy, waste-to-energy, and other vaguely greenish things. Meanwhile, natural gas and nuclear power continue to dominate the IEPMP, making the entire renewable section of the policy feel like a reluctant afterthought, written at 2:00am before a donor meeting.\nIt gets better\u2014or worse, depending on your appetite for bureaucratic chaos. The draft assigns oversight of renewable energy projects to the Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority (SREDA ), while giving licensing power to the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission. So now, we're left with a classic two-headed administrative monster. One body to dream up ideas, another to sign them off, and both to blame each other when nothing gets done.\nFinancing? That part is written in invisible ink. The policy mumbles about a Sustainable Energy Development Fund but uses delightful hedging language like \"may be implemented\" and \"could be considered.\" Which is a bit like a marriage proposal that goes, \"I might, perhaps, love you\u2026 in theory.\" It name-drops Bangladesh Bank and the Infrastructure Development Company Limited but forgets to outline how any of this will translate into real money. There's not a single concrete strategy to generate the billions of dollars necessary for this transition. And foreign investors? The policy greets them with all the warmth of a Dhaka traffic jam. No incentives, no guarantees, just a polite shrug and a vague mention of possible stamp duty waivers.\nIndustries, which consume most of the electricity in the country, don't fare much better. The draft policy gives a casual nod to rooftop solar for factories but offers no real blueprint for integrating solar energy into the energy-hungry manufacturing sector. It dangles carrots like \"production-linked incentives may be provided\" and \"waivers may be considered for EVs,\" without saying anything. The entire policy reads like a horoscope\u2014generously vague, suspiciously optimistic, and completely open to interpretation.\nAnd what of our national grid? Ah, yes, that antique piece of electrical infrastructure, about as ready for a renewable revolution as a tea kettle is for launching satellites. Our solar projects sit idle because the grid can't handle the load. Wind projects are stuck in limbo. Meanwhile, someone from the ministry insists it was all \"working fine yesterday.\"\nMeanwhile, ministers cruise around in fossil-fuel-guzzling sports utility vehicles (SUVs), giving speeches about green energy in front of billboards that read \"Go Green\" in fonts large enough to be visible from outer space. It's satire that writes itself.\nSo, what can actually be done? For starters, REP 2025 needs a serious rewrite. Targets must be based on sound projections, not fantasies. A proper fossil fuel phase-out timeline must be included. Financial incentives should be made real, not theoretical. Off-grid and rooftop solar should be given a central role in industrial zones. SREDA needs to be empowered with full licensing authority, so at least someone is clearly in charge. And above all, we need to swap out all those \"may\"s and \"could\"s for \"shall\"s and \"will\"s\u2014because climate change doesn't respond to passive voice.\nRight now, Bangladesh's renewable energy policy looks like it was written to impress donors and confuse citizens. And as we fumble forward with candles during load-shedding, fanning ourselves with expired optimism, it's worth remembering potential means nothing without action.\nThus, here's hoping we graduate from glossy dreams to gritty implementation. Because sunlight may be free, but stupidity is proving to be very, very expensive.\nBarrister Noshin Nawal\u00a0is an activist, feminist, and a columnist for The Daily Star.

        "full_article": "It is deeply troubling to learn about the persistent abuse and exploitation faced by our female migrant workers abroad, as well as the depression and social isolation they experience upon returning home. According to a BRAC report, more than 4.7 lakh Bangladeshi migrant workers have returned over the past six years after enduring various forms of mistreatment and hardship. Among them, 67,199 women suffered sexual and physical abuse. In 2020 alone, 49,924 women were sent back, primarily from Middle Eastern countries. Upon their return, many shared harrowing accounts of their experiences. While the authorities in Bangladesh have done little to protect their rights abroad, they have also failed to provide the support necessary for their reintegration at home.\nA combination of factors including financial struggles, lack of education and skills, unemployment, social insecurity, and environmental hardships often compel women to seek employment abroad. However, their desperate attempts to find better economic opportunities often end in exploitation, as they fall victim to trafficking, forced labour, and gender-based violence. In many cases, their wages are withheld, and working conditions are harsh, but they can hardly seek help due to language barriers. Restrictions on movement and communication further deepen their plight.\nAnd it does not end upon return either. Many come home with serious injuries, illnesses, and psychological trauma, yet receive no support at the airport or access to medical care. Mental health challenges such as trauma, depression, and social isolation make their lives even more difficult, while many are burdened with debt. According to a 2023 study by the Bangladesh National Women Lawyers' Association, a staggering 37.3 percent of female migrants returned home empty-handed. Many also struggle to find work due to social stigma. Unless the government addresses these challenges, their dream for reintegration will remain out of reach.\nWe, therefore, urge the authorities to develop gender-responsive migration policies that protect the rights of female migrant workers and take meaningful action to improve their lives upon return. These vulnerable women need adequate medical care, psychological support, and financial assistance. The government must also ensure that the migration process is more sustainable. Instead of sending unskilled workers abroad, it should provide training to aspiring migrants, equipping them with the knowledge of their rights and responsibilities in destination countries.

However, it is astonishing to learn from a recent elaborate field report by a correspondent of the Financial Express that, despite the country's global campaign for climate funds, it has yet to implement a sound climate financing mechanism at the grassroots level. For example, Union Parishads (UPs) - the lowest tier of government - are expected to safeguard communities from rising sea levels, salinity, tidal surges, and crumbling infrastructure. Yet, they have no designated budget for climate change adaptation or mitigation. Consequently, the occasional climate-related expenditures that some UPs receive in coastal areas are buried under vague categories such as \"repair and maintenance\" or \"disaster response,\" rendering frontline climate action virtually invisible in national accounts. This is not merely an accounting oversight-it is a systemic failure.\nBangladesh has rightly earned international recognition for its climate vulnerability and proactive planning at the national level. The Ministry of Environment and Forests was renamed to include \"Climate Change,\" and flagship initiatives such as the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP) and multi-donor programmes like local government initiative on climate change (LoGIC) have been launched. Yet, at the grassroots level, the impact remains minimal and largely symbolic. The standardised UP budget template issued by the government includes dozens of expenditure heads-such as education, health, agriculture, and WASH - but conspicuously omits climate change. Even the term \"resilience\" is absent. Does climate financing warrant such low priority that it does not deserve a dedicated budget head in the local government's budget template? This omission is not just about a matter of wording or terminology. As a UP chairman rightly pointed out, without a budget head, there is no planning. Without planning, there is no data. This is why national-level reports on climate financing often cite the unavailability of data at the UP level. How can such data exist when there is no formal space to record it in the first place?\nThis highlights that, despite the presence of donor-funded programmes and high-level international commitments, the government has failed to institutionalise climate finance where it matters most-at the community level. Union Parishads may be the lowest and smallest tier of government, but they are the first line of defence when disaster strikes. They open cyclone shelters, distribute relief, mobilise volunteers, coordinate repairs, and, when necessary, bury the dead. Therefore, they must be equipped with adequate funding and manpower to build a robust defence against climate change. Regrettably, climate action in Bangladesh remains fragmented and project-based, lacking the cohesion and continuity required for long-term resilience. This piecemeal approach, combined with a top-down framework, continues to leave local governments disempowered and unprepared. To build long-term resilience, the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Local Government, and Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change must act together to revise the UP budget template in the upcoming fiscal year. A dedicated budget heading for climate action would allow local government bodies to plan, spend and track funds effectively-and generate essential data regarding climate financing. Most importantly, it would enable local government officials to take proactive measures, rather than reacting after disasters strike.\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

But what is a modern, developed nation? The model before them was the nation states of Europe. But after the colonial powers left, the national leaders who took on the mantle of power failed to fulfil the people's dreams. People first lost faith in the changes in government through elections as every elected government proved to be equally corrupt and inefficient in the 1950s when present-day Bangladesh was part of then-Pakistan. Taking advantage of the failure of elected governments, the military took power and ran the show till 1970. The rest of the history every child knows as to how a politically independent Bangladesh was born. But nothing changed. The same old electoral games which demagogues played on the people's sentiments, fears, false hopes and prejudices to somehow usurp state power. The post-independence Bangladesh saw bloody as well as peaceful elected governments. The last such elected civilian government was the immediate-past one that transformed into one of the worst autocracies the people of Bangladesh had ever experienced. So, the people over the past decades had only voted governments into office or ousted them by force from power in the hope that the new one would finally be one that could bring the long-cherished changes remaining free from corruption and greed. Now we have the new political dispensation followed by a student-led popular political upsurge that replaced autocracy with the incumbent interim government led by its Chief Adviser Dr Muhammad Yunus. Now what does the public expect from this government formed in the wake of a bloody and popular upsurge? Certainly, the men, women and children from all sections of society who fought the autocracy to their last breath didn't make such sacrifces for nothing. It was, of course, not to start the same old, rotten game of politics to start all over again. People now wanted to see a qualitative change in politics. They wanted a government free from the ills that again and again gave rise to anti-people, corrupt and inefficient political systems and governments. To achieve this, they want a systemic overhauling in the vital organs of the state. Most importantly, the existing administrative setup, which is a legacy of the British colonial period, should go through radical reform. The interim government has its main agenda of reforming major institutions of governance and, for the purpose, formed commissions to recommend the required reforms.\nThe idea is to restructure the major institutions of governance that are inherently corrupt. The major such institutions include the constitution, the public administration, the judiciary, the police, the anti-corrupton commission and the election commission. True, it is not conceivable that a government riding the wave of a popular upsurge would be able to fix an old, moth-eaten system overnight. Moreover, it has not also promised as such. In fact, political systems change through long phases of trial and error. As it happened over the centuries in Europe. Societies there were luckier in some respects in that they at the same time also produced great social thinkers who came up with new ideas about state and its governance. Unfortunately, in Bangladesh's, or for that matter, the entire post-colonial sub-continent's case, no such thinker, say, like the English John Locke, Scottish David Hume, French Voltaire, or Genevan Enlightenment philosopher Russueau was born to show new ways to build society and politics. But there were also not many local thinkers who could come up with a proper guide that new, post-colonial generations of social change agents could be inspired by and follow. There were, however, occasional attempts at building revolutionary parties of the working class in the style of Leninist communist party of Russia or Mao-led Chinese communist party and bring about a revolutionary change in society. But those attempts in general failed to build their revolutionary politics based on the history and culture of local people. Worse yet, some even started it by outright rejection of local beliefs, values and cultures. Obviously, the mass people, too, rejected them. In some cases, revivalist nationalist politics, which, too, is a European phenomenon, struck root in local soil in the form of religious or cultural nationalism. These are, however, the most odious forms of nationalism that are based on hatred of other cultures and religions. Recently, on both shores of the Atlantic, such racist-and-culturual supremacy-based politics is on the rise. As it happened in the case of other kinds of western ideas, euphemistically termed identity-politics, too, has raised its head across the subcontinent. Amid this maelstrom of political ideas, the post-uprising Bangladesh has been experimenting with the idea of a government that is a restructured, if not a revolutionary, versions of the existing state institutions.\n\nHence is the debate on reforms. Existing, traditional political parties, however, think it should be business as usual. The interim government, in their view, should finish their reform job as soon as possible and leave the rest for them to complete. But the younger generation who gave their all to bring about the current political change won't listen to that. Hence is the ongoing controversies and street marches surrounding various issues and demands. But there lies danger in such developments. The youth, whatever their political ideas, are , to all appearance, on a collision course with the rest of socio-political and state-institutions. Rather, there should start a dialogue across the board. What has to be accepted by all traditional and post-upsurge generation of political forces is that the post-interim government politics of the country is not going to be business as usual. Even if any attempt is made to return to the old style of politics- election-based politics dominated by musclemen and goons-then we are in for a bigger, bloodier socio-political unrest in the future. So, a dialogue between the traditional and the emergent forces of change is essential. The old should come forward to meet the new. \nsfalim.ds@gmail.com\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Aedes aegypti serves as the vector of dengue virus in spreading the disease, at times in an epidemic form. Now the news is that wolbachia, a bacteria found in butterflies and some species of mosquitoes but not in aedes has the potential to render dengue virus biologically inactive. But it does not happen naturally. Scientists have had to intervene. An international team of scientists from the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, the University of Queensland, the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research (ICDDR), Bangladesh and the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention has developed a wolbachia-infected strain of aedes called 'good mosquito' that can adapt to the tropical condition prevailing in the capital or perhaps Bangladesh. \nNow the wolbachia-infected mosquito loses the capacity to transmit not only the dengue virus but also the viruses of chikungunia and zika. While it acts as an antidote against dengue, chikungunia and zika viruses, it is safe for human beings and the environment. It is like, as a conventional Bangla adage can be translated, 'one thorn drives away another'. This heat-tolerant strain of Wolbachia was developed through cross-breeding with several generations of local aedes varieties.\nThe research team proposes to do the trick by employing two methods. First, the suppression method that envisages release of wolbachia-infected males developed in laboratory, which when mate with wild females, the eggs will become unviable. In the process, the mosquito population will decline on its own. The other is replacement method which approves release of both male and female infected with wolbachia bacterium. Here the objective is to see that the successive generations of mosquito offspring carry the bacterium and gradually replace the virus-carrying females which alone cause dengue and other diseases. \nThis biological containment of the aedes, however, is not unique to Bangladesh. Quite a few countries have successfully applied this by this time. In northern Queensland, the success rate of containment has been 96 per cent. The control rate of this sub-species of mosquitoes is 95 per cent in Indonesia, Brazil, Colombia, Malaysia, Singapore and the United States of America. The heat-tolerant variety suitable for release in conditions and climes like those of Dhaka has shown 92.7 per cent reduction in transmission of dengue virus. The rate is a little lower than in the countries mentioned above but still it is good enough to bring the aedes population under control provided that the outcome in the open condition corresponds to the laboratory test results. \nFumigation and other methods applied so far to fight dengue has proved mostly futile. This biological system of control is preferable because it is unlikely to have any adverse impact on the environment. Scientists claim that infecting mosquito with Wolbachia is no genetic medication because the natural bacterium is present in butterflies and other varieties of mosquitoes. If this is no genetic transformation, the scientific tinkering with the vector's capacity to transmit the dengue virus does not pose the threat of evolution of dangerous strains of mosquitoes. However, if the population of aedes aegypti is drastically limited or, in extreme cases, eliminated, will there be another strain of mosquitoes to replace it? Researchers may spare a thought for any such possibility. \nPresently, though, local etymologists have expressed their scepticism about the success of the drive. Some of them think that the strain of aedes developed in laboratory will be weaker and fail to compete with their wild counterparts. In a highly crowded city, aedes mosquitoes have their breeding ground in the most congested spots of residential accommodations where the laboratory-bred type will fail to reach. Considering this argument substantive, however, there is no reason to abandon the project. After all, mosquitoes have to come to people at some point to bite and infect the latter. The laboratory type will have a meeting point there and avail of the chance to neutralise the wild variety's infection capability. There is no harm in considering release of wolbachia-infected aedes a vital part of an integrated strategy for controlling mosquitoes that act as vectors of dengue and other related diseases.\nnilratanhalder2000@yahoo.com\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

CU is perhaps the only university in the world where such a train remains in regular operation, making it the primary means of transport for thousands of students. \nHowever, this symbol of convenience and unity has unfortunately turned into a source of frustration and suffering for many.\nAt present, only two shuttle trains serve the vast student population, resulting in severe overcrowding. Students are frequently compelled to travel standing, often jostling for space to their utter discomfort. Mechanical issues have also become alarmingly frequent, yet the university administration appears to have taken no visible or effective measures to address them.\nPerhaps the most frightening concern is the regular occurrence of stone-throwing incidents, particularly targeting night shuttle services. \nThese attacks have escalated recently, leaving students in a constant state of fear for their safety. The presence of unauthorised outsiders aboard the trains further heightens this insecurity.\nMoreover, the journey between the university and the city can take over two hours each way, consuming valuable time and severely affecting students' academic and personal lives. Schedule disruptions are also common, causing students to miss classes or appointments.\nIt is high time the university administration takes this matter seriously.\n Increasing the number of shuttle trains, ensuring regular maintenance, improving security, and establishing a strict policy against external intrusion are necessary steps. If action is not taken promptly, what was once a symbol of love and pride may forever be remembered as a tale of neglect and sorrow by the suffering students.\nObaidul Mustafa Shiblee\nStudent, Department of Marketing\nUniversity of Chittagong\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
