        "full_article": "The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee\u2019s decisions, on Friday, show that the central bank is now unequivocally choosing growth in the perennial growth-inflation trade-off. This is the correct approach at this time. The first major decision was to cut the repo rate by 50 basis points to 5.5%. It comes on the back of two cuts of 25 basis points each, in February and April. With the latest retail inflation coming in at a 69-month low, and generally exhibiting a subdued trend, price stability has now been relegated as a secondary concern. These rate cuts will, once the banks transmit them to borrowers, make it cheaper for companies and consumers to borrow to invest and purchase. The second major decision, of slashing the cash reserve ratio by 100 basis points, will help with the transmission of the rate cuts. The less that banks have to keep with themselves, as stipulated by the cash reserve ratio, the more they can lend out \u2014 and now at lower rates. It is worth noting, however, that the central bank has again changed its stance. In April, it had moved from being neutral to being accommodative, indicating that it was inclined to cut rates further. It has now moved back to neutral, meaning more rate cuts in the short term are unlikely, unless growth falls well short of expectations. This is a sensible stance to take, given the vast uncertainties that the Indian and global economies are facing. The neutral stance also means that the RBI is equally predisposed to raise rates again in the event of an unforeseen and sustained spike in prices. The monsoon is yet to fully play out, after all.The timing of these decisions is sound. Inflation is low and not likely to jump any time soon if current factors remain unchanged. Further, there are no major elections now that would otherwise have necessitated a pre-emptive strong grip on price levels. On the other hand, growth is lower than it could be. The RBI has projected growth in the current financial year 2025-26 to be 6.5%, which is no faster than what the government provisionally estimated for the previous year. Fiscal policy in terms of government spending has reached the limit of the stimulus it can provide. After a decade of increasing outlays, government capital expenditure can at best be maintained at the level it is at, but cannot reasonably be expected to grow much further. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and officials in the Ministry of Finance have indicated as much. Apart from developmental and social priorities, the government now has additional defence spending to account for. Monetary policy has to step up and boost growth, and it is good to see the RBI and the government on the same page.

        "full_article": "President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to ban citizens from 12 countries from entering the United States, citing national security concerns, is yet another attempt by his five-month-old administration to tear down legal migration. Mr. Trump\u2019s decision in 2017, during his first term, to ban citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries had triggered chaos and protests at America\u2019s airports, evoked criticism of the unstated racism and xenophobia, and led to legal challenges. This time, Mr. Trump has focused on mostly West Asia and Africa. Citizens from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen would be banned, while people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela will face restrictions. The ban applies only to people outside the U.S. but those with active visas who leave the country could face difficulty during re-entry. Mr. Trump argued that the ban, which came days after the arrest of an Egyptian man for carrying out an attack on a group honouring the Gaza hostages, would help prevent terrorist attacks and keep out those who overstay their visas. Egypt, a close American ally, and Spain, which saw 20,000 of its citizens overstay their visas in 2023, are not on the list, but Chad, whose visa overstay number is as low as 400, is.Since his swearing-in as the President, in January, for the second time, Mr. Trump has taken a series of measures to crack down on migration. He has suspended the asylum system at the southern border and ended temporary legal residency for Haitians, Venezuelans and Cubans. He has also removed the legal status of thousands of foreign students and instructed U.S. diplomatic missions to pause scheduling new visa interviews as his administration prepares to vet the social media handles of students and scholars. His policies targeting international students have already spread chaos and uncertainty across America\u2019s universities. Now, the outright ban on citizens from a group of countries reinforces the erosion of the self-image of the U.S. \u2014 \u201cthe shining city on a hill\u201d as Ronald Reagan once called it \u2014 as a pluralistic, open society. Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that immigrants bring crime into the U.S. is ill-founded. Many of the people seeking entry into the U.S., from countries that had seen American military intervention, such as Haiti and Afghanistan, are fleeing war, persecution and systemic violence. They are not national security threats but victims in search of refuge. By shutting America\u2019s doors on them, and immigrants in general, Mr. Trump is not making the U.S. safer. Rather, he is turning a country, which historically welcomed immigration and has benefited from it, into an insular, paranoid, self-doubting republic.

        "full_article": "By Farida Khanam\nAlso known as the Festival of Sacrifice, Eid al-Adha is one of Islam\u2019s most spiritually profound celebrations. On the day of Eid, two outward acts are performed: the congregational Eid prayer and ritual sacrifice of an animal.\nToday, however, when Muslims think of Eid al-Adha, they often do not think beyond the ritual sacrifice. Many of the festival\u2019s deeper meanings \u2013 its focus on God-orientation, selflessness, and spiritual growth \u2013 have gradually faded from public awareness.\nAt the heart of Eid al-Adha lies the Quranic story of Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham), who was willing to sacrifice what he loved most in submission to the divine command. This moment defines the essence of Islam itself: surrendering one\u2019s ego, will, and attachments for the sake of God. The Quran reminds us: \u201cIt is not their flesh or blood that reaches God, but your piety.\u201d (22:37)\nThis verse underscores the point that the true value of sacrifice lies not in the ritual but in the intention and consciousness behind it. The real question is whether we have sacrificed our ego, pride, selfishness, and greed.\n\nConsider Bilal ibn Rabah\u2019s insights, a close companion of the Prophet, who said: \u201cI do not mind if I sacrifice a rooster. But to give its price in charity to an orphan or a poor person is more beloved to me than sacrificing it,\u201d Musannaf Abd al-Razzaq, Hadith 8409. Bilal\u2019s insight elevates ethical spirit over mere ritual observance. It teaches that value of an act lies in the good it generates.\nAs the Prophet has observed: \u201cThe best among you is the one from whom good is expected, and from whose harm people feel safe,\u201d Sunan al-Tirmidhi, Hadith 2263. Eid al-Adha, in this sense, serves as a powerful spiritual reminder to embody selflessness in daily life. It calls upon Muslims to become sources of compassion and peace, especially for the marginalised, needy, and those without a voice.\nEid al-Adha coincides with Hajj, the pilgrimage commemorating trials of Ibrahim, Hajar (wife), and Ismail (son). Each Hajj rite \u2013 whether standing at Arafat, stoning the pillars in Mina, or sacrificing an animal \u2013 represents symbolic acts of letting go of pride, anger, and materialism.\nTrue celebration in Islam is not measured by festivity or excess, but by remembrance, gratitude, and moral responsibility. The Quran describes Prophet Ibrahim as \u2018thankful for His blessings\u2019 (16:121) \u2013 a reminder that real joy comes from acknowledging divine guidance, even amidst trials.\nEid al-Adha should therefore be seen not as a single-day event, but as a spiritual summit \u2013 a moment for introspection, transformation, and recommitment to God. It challenges the believer to reflect: \u2018Have I surrendered my will to the Divine, as Ibrahim did? Have I helped someone in need, even at personal cost? Have I purified my inner self of resentment, sense of superiority, and greed?\u2019\nThese are true offerings of Eid. The real sacrifice lies in letting go of our ego. Eid al-Adha is more than just a celebration \u2013 Ibrahim\u2019s legacy calls for more than ceremonial obedience; it demands moral courage and deep compassion.\nIn an increasingly divided world, the message of Eid al-Adha is more relevant than ever: true submission to God is inseparable from service to humanity.\n\n",

        "full_article": "The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) just made a big decision. It cut interest rates again \u2014 this time by 0.5% (or 50 basis points). That\u2019s good news for people who have to pay EMIs (monthly loan payments), because their payments could now become cheaper.\nSo why did RBI do this? The goal is to help India\u2019s economy grow faster. In the last few months, the economy grew by 7.4%, which sounds great. But most of that growth came from the government spending money on building things like roads and bridges. Factories and companies making goods (that\u2019s called manufacturing) didn\u2019t grow much. And that\u2019s a problem because strong factory growth means more jobs and more money in people\u2019s pockets.\nFor India to grow well this year, people need to spend more \u2014 especially on things like cars and homes. These industries give jobs to millions of people. To help with that, RBI has already made loans cheaper three times this year. Now it\u2019s hoping that cheaper loans will make more people buy homes and cars, which will boost the economy.\nPrices of things (inflation) have finally stopped rising so fast, so the RBI felt safe enough to cut rates. But some experts think people aren\u2019t buying more because they simply don\u2019t earn enough. After Covid, many carmakers and builders started making only expensive models. Small, cheaper cars and homes became rare. So middle-class families couldn\u2019t afford them.\nNow, with cheaper loans, the RBI hopes more middle-income families can buy these things again. If that happens, businesses will also invest more in new projects \u2014 and that will help the economy grow. But if it doesn\u2019t, the government may need to focus on helping people earn more money.\nRBI has said it won\u2019t cut rates again soon. So now, everyone\u2019s waiting to see: Will this plan work?\n\n",

        "full_article": "On World Environment Day, the conversation around plastic pollution takes centre stage\u2014globally, in treaty rooms and international campaigns, and locally, as we stare at rivers choked by waste and fields littered with non-biodegradable remnants of daily survival. But too often, we isolate the plastic crisis from the human beings at its centre: the families, farmers, vendors, and millions for whom plastic is not a convenience but a necessity\u2014a needed tool for carrying goods to work on a rainy day, building shelter to withstand torrential rains when there is no roof overhead, or simply storing belongings when even a tin trunk is unaffordable.\n\nPlastic must be removed from our lives, for it kills\u2014whether through choking rivers and oceans, or through the CO2 emitted in its production. But this can only happen when alternatives become reachable for the unrecognised faces who use it daily, not just for ease but for necessity. In a country like Bangladesh, where the vast majority live on the edge of survival, affordability and availability dictate choice. The conversation around alternatives must begin by asking: What will people use instead? And how will they afford it? If those answers remain unclear, expecting sudden behavioural shifts or blanket bans is not only unrealistic, it is unjust.\nWe need to find a solution that is both humane and environmentally responsible. We cannot presume to restrict plastic use only through regulation. We must provide alternatives and instil an understanding of the harm it causes, especially among those who rely on it most. People must feel connected to the cause, to understand that this is about protecting the rivers, the land, and the environment we all share. When the message speaks to the heart, not just through statistics or enforcement, it inspires collective responsibility. That is where real, lasting change begins.\nToday, we speak of climate treaties and plastic bans. But unless the state becomes personal\u2014unless the farmer understands why it matters to him, unless the mother in a char village sees what plastic waste might do to her child's future\u2014we will not see real transformation. A policy that asks millions to give up a necessity must not descend like an order. It must rise from understanding, built through empathy and communicated in language that respects people's lives and acknowledges their realities.\nThe global plastic treaty being negotiated, as reported in\u00a0IISD's Earth Negotiations Bulletin, is a welcome step. But it must not absolve us of our responsibilities at home. Plastic is already having an incredibly negative impact on the quality of our lives. Our rivers are clogged. Our waste systems are inadequate. While international consensus can help us gain legitimacy in our actions, we are already suffering daily from the lack of regulation and alternatives. We cannot wait for consensus to take shape. We need to act now\u2014but act wisely\u2014so that the millions who rely on plastic today are able to shift to alternatives, even if those alternatives are not yet as useful.\nAt the same time, we must resist imported narratives that do not fit our context. Western countries, with their histories of industrial growth, carbon emissions, and pollution, have created much of this crisis. But this is not about them feeling guilt. Guilt can be brushed aside\u2014by individuals, by corporations. What we must appeal to is conscience. One person's conscience can lead hundreds to positive action. If there is to be a global commitment to healing, it should not be framed as reparations for the past, but as a response to the suffering of the present. Let conscience, not compensation, guide the way forward.\nBack home, we must learn to see the nuances. Not all plastic is single-use or wasteful. In Bangladesh, we reuse everything. A plastic bottle may be used for months. Plastic furniture allows families to live with dignity. On a recent visit to a shop in Kachua, I was handed a plastic bag labelled \"100 percent biodegradable.\" Bioplastics like those being developed by Sonali Bag may hold promise. But we must ensure that sustainability does not become another form of inequality, where the poor are penalised for using what they can afford, while the rich purchase expensive \"eco\" products.\nEven a seemingly progressive decision, such as banning plastic and requiring only glass in offices, raises valid questions. The intention is noble. But how do small businesses comply? What happens to vendors who cannot afford the transition? Policy without inclusion becomes exclusion.\nSo, what should we do?\nWe must begin with awareness that respects, not lectures. Speak to people in their own language\u2014not only linguistically, but through their lived experience. Show them that if the rivers are blocked, if the fish die, if the soil degrades, their own lives will be affected. And then, crucially, provide real alternatives. No one wants to harm the environment. But no one should be forced to choose between dignity and sustainability.\n\nIt is possible to mobilise people\u2014especially the young\u2014when they feel part of a collective mission. It is possible to educate without blame. To act without alienating. To build, not just ban.\nLet us mark this World Environment Day not with more slogans, but with sincerity. Let us appeal not just to policies and politics, but to the hearts of people. Because only when environmental responsibility becomes personal, deeply human and emotionally understood, will we begin to see real change.\nLet us make the state personal. Let us make conscience our most powerful policy.\nRuna Khan is founder and executive director of Friendship.\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.\nFollow\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0Opinion\u00a0on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the latest opinions, commentaries and analyses by experts and professionals.

        "full_article": "As Muslims around the world prepare to celebrate Eid-ul-Azha, it is a time to reflect on the values of sacrifice and gratitude that this festival embodies. These principles resonate deeply especially when millions in Gaza are facing hunger and death under Israeli attacks, and hundreds of Rohingya children are being denied their right to education. Closer to home, some workers are returning to their villages without receiving salaries or bonuses. Then there are the road accidents that have become a tragic routine during every Eid, as tens of thousands of people travel from cities to spend the holidays with loved ones.\n\nAlthough, like during Eid-ul-Fitr earlier in the year, bus, train, and launch journeys have so far been relatively smooth, several road accidents and at least one robbery on the highway have already occurred, despite increased patrols by law enforcement. However, the responsibility of ensuring safety on highways and river routes does not rest solely with the authorities\u2014it is shared by passengers, transport owners, and drivers alike. Passengers, too, must avoid overcrowded or unfit vehicles, while owners and drivers must prioritise safety over profit, avoiding reckless driving. Law enforcement officials must also remain vigilant.\n\nAnother critical aspect that calls for both responsible behaviour and proper planning is the sacrifice of animals. As we celebrate this act of devotion, we must not lose sight of our duty to show kindness to all living beings. Sacrificial animals should not be subjected to unnecessary cruelty. In cities and municipalities, we must ensure that animal waste and other refuse from our households and neighbourhoods are properly disposed of, and that streets, footpaths, and house premises where animals are kept or sacrificed are thoroughly cleaned.\n\nThis Eid-ul-Azha marks the first in which municipal and city corporations are being overseen by administrators rather than elected representatives. Many of these administrators are also juggling responsibilities in other government departments. However, this must not be used as an excuse for delays in post-Eid cleanliness drives. On the contrary, swift waste disposal should be treated as a top priority, especially as monsoon rains could worsen the stench and spread of blood, creating ideal conditions for the breeding of dengue mosquitoes. We also hope that the efforts of Dhaka South City Corporation will not be disrupted, as they were for 21 days when supporters of BNP leader Ishraque Hossain staged protests at Nagar Bhaban.\nWe wish everyone a safe and joyful Eid.\n",

        "full_article": "We are surprised to learn of the promulgation of the National Freedom Fighters Council (Amendment) Ordinance-2025 that replaces the National Freedom Fighters Council Act-2022, redefining some key aspects related to the Liberation War. At a time when the nation is navigating an extremely fragile transition to democracy, this adds yet another element of confusion and controversy that we could do without. Codifying a more restrictive, combat-oriented definition of freedom fighters (FFs) and the war itself might seem justified in an ideal sense, especially given the history of political exploitations under Awami League. But it also reflects a potential reframing of national memory that no bureaucracy should be entrusted with.\n\nIt's true that much of the initial confusion about the ordinance stemmed from flawed reporting, particularly erroneous claims about the \"revocation\" of the recognition of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Tajuddin Ahmad, and other national heroes as freedom fighters. But partly responsible for it is the redefinition of a \"freedom fighter\" and the introduction of three new categories, including that of an \"associate of the Liberation War\"\u2014thus dividing all previously recognised under the broad term of freedom fighters into distinct groups. For example, all Members of the National Assembly (MNAs) and Members of the Provincial Assembly (MPAs) who were aligned with the wartime provisional government and later became members of the Constituent Assembly will now be considered \"associates,\" whereas those who led the provisional government will continue to be recognised as FFs. These categories overlap in some cases, and exclude in others, creating grounds for ambiguities.\n\nWhile the reclassification may not affect the benefits received by freedom fighters or their families\u2014as later clarified by the adviser to the Ministry of Liberation War Affairs\u2014the real question is: was this reframing, and the symbolic rollback of recognition for some, necessary at all? If there are concerns about \"fake\" freedom fighters, this approach will certainly not help. On the contrary, it piles on existing bureaucratic workload by necessitating fresh examinations of status. By defining a \"freedom fighter's family\" strictly as their spouse, son, daughter, father, or mother, the ordinance appears to align with the post-uprising restructuring of job quotas that no longer extend to their grandchildren. But again, these objectives could have been pursued without wading into what some perceive as a revisionist attempt. At the very least, the government could have consulted with political parties to generate consensus on such a divisive issue.\n\nThe government has interfered in such historical matters in the past as well. Instead of doing what is ideally the responsibility of historians or society at large, we feel the interim government, which by definition is meant to do only crucial tasks, should focus on more urgent and present-day reforms that the nation is eagerly waiting to see. And whatever it does, it should stop bringing a top-down approach to critical reforms.\n",

        "full_article": "The extent to which the right to file cases has been exploited in the wake of the July uprising boggles the mind. It was only the other day that we commented on the questionable manner in which a 69-year-old former professor accused in an attempted murder case was treated. The case\u2014filed by a former Jagannath University Chhatra Dal leader who was injured in a clash at the height of the uprising\u2014had several hallmarks of a dubious case, including its lodging after about seven months since the alleged crime and mass listing of accused individuals (193 in total). Yet she was singled out, arrested, denied bail, and sent to jail. As we try to process the role likely played by police and magistrate courts in enabling such cases, we are again reminded of their absurdities by yet another case reported by this daily.\nThe victim this time, strange as it may seem, is a \"dead\" man coming alive. According to our report, Md Selim, a grocer from Mymensingh's Phulbaria, was falsely declared dead in a murder case filed over the July uprising. Lodged by his elder brother, with two other brothers serving as witnesses, the case claims that Selim was shot dead by police in Dhaka's Jatrabari on August 3 and later buried in Gopibagh. It also falsely implicates 41 people, including the ousted PM Sheikh Hasina.\n\nSelim is now fighting a surreal legal battle just to prove he exists, scurrying from office to office, facing severe harassment, and fearing for his life as a potential murder would fit the narrative of his \"death.\" The motive behind this case, as recent police investigations have uncovered, is a family dispute over inherited land. With Selim having no sons, his three brothers allegedly sought to seize his share by exploiting the chaos of the uprising to eliminate him, at least on paper.\nSelim is now fighting a surreal legal battle just to prove he exists, scurrying from office to office, facing severe harassment, and fearing for his life as a potential murder would fit the narrative of his \"death.\" The motive behind this case, as recent police investigations have uncovered, is a family dispute over inherited land. With Selim having no sons, his three brothers allegedly sought to seize his share by exploiting the chaos of the uprising to eliminate him, at least on paper.\nThat the legal system could be weaponised so easily for personal gain, and that such a bizarre case could progress as far as it did, speaks volumes about the merit of many of the cases filed over July atrocities. The incident also raises alarm about the integrity of those responsible for vetting or handling such cases. If an alive man can be shown as dead, and a 69-year-old widow arbitrarily jailed, how many other opportunistic or retaliatory cases have slipped through the cracks? We call on the authorities to urgently review all such politically or personally motivated cases, and hold to account those filing or enabling them. No one must be allowed to exploit the legal system or the July uprising.\n",
