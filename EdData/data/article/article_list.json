Mr. Kamra\u2019s use of the word \u2018gaddar (traitor\u2019) in a parody of a Hindi film song, seemingly targeting an unnamed politician\u2019s rise, has reportedly offended Mr. Shinde\u2019s supporters and other Shiv Sena members. In a bizarre act of misplaced retaliation, a group attacked \u2018Habitat\u2019, the studio where Mr. Kamra had performed \u2014 an attempt to impose vicarious liability on the venue instead of the artist. The Mumbai police booked Mr. Kamra under provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) related to promoting enmity and causing public mischief, as well as defamation. However, it is well-established that defamation charges can only be initiated by the aggrieved party, and not by the police. In a now-familiar display of power being weaponised, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) conveniently discovered unauthorised structures outside the venue and demolished them, continuing to probe for further \u201cirregularities\u201d. The first information report against Mr. Kamra appears to be a clear misuse of laws meant to address divisive speech. It essentially criminalises satire directed at a public figure\u2019s political actions. Politicians being labelled as traitors or turncoats after switching parties is hardly new \u2014 ironically, Ajit Pawar of the Nationalist Congress Party, who once used the same term, now serves alongside Mr. Shinde as Deputy Chief Minister.The Maharashtra government is now demanding a public apology from Mr. Kamra, which he has refused, though he has expressed his willingness to cooperate with any lawful investigation. It is incumbent upon the State government to ensure its actions remain within legal bounds and not appear as arbitrary retaliations. While it is commendable that a few Shiv Sena members have been booked for the vandalism, the case must be pursued to its logical end. The invocation of \u201churt sentiments\u201d to justify violent loyalty has gone too far. Increasingly, such claims are being used to legitimise mob attacks, undermining the free and open space essential for democratic discourse.

        "full_article": "State crackdowns on political opposition are hardly new in President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s T\u00fcrkiye. Since coming to power in 2003 as Prime Minister, and later assuming the presidency under a revised Constitution, Mr. Erdo\u011fan and his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) have shown little tolerance for dissent. His government has systematically targeted political opponents, journalists, activists and critics. Yet, even by T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s troubled democratic standards, the arrest of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem \u0130mamo\u011flu marks a troubling escalation. He was detained on March 19, 2025 on charges of corruption and alleged ties to terrorism \u2014 accusations largely stemming from his association with pro-Kurdish political groups. His arrest came just days before he was expected to be officially named the presidential candidate of the main opposition Republican People\u2019s Party (CHP). On March 23, an Istanbul court ordered his formal arrest, and he was swiftly removed from office by the Interior Ministry. He is the fifth CHP mayor to be dismissed by the government in recent months.The move has sparked massive protests. In a show of public defiance, the CHP held a primary open to the general electorate \u2014 not just party members \u2014 in which it claimed the participation of 15 million voters, choosing Mr. \u0130mamo\u011flu as their presidential nominee. Mr. Erdo\u011fan has dismissed the protests, but the motive behind this orchestrated campaign is clear. With his presidential term set to end in 2028, he is constitutionally barred from running again \u2014 unless early elections are called, or the Constitution is amended. But Parliament may trigger snap elections, paving the way for his seeking another term, particularly as he lacks a clear successor within the AKP. Mr. \u0130mamo\u011flu, meanwhile, has emerged as the most potent opposition figure in years. Since winning the Istanbul mayoralty in 2019, he has helped revive the CHP\u2019s national prospects. In last year\u2019s local elections, the party secured its strongest result since the 1970s, even outpolling the AKP nationwide. While Mr. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s popularity has declined amid rampant inflation, economic stagnation, and a plunging lira \u2014 eroding the appeal of his once-successful blend of Islamic conservatism and pro-business policies \u2014 Mr. \u0130mamo\u011flu, a self-proclaimed social democrat, has offered a progressive alternative that is focused on expanded social services and inclusive growth. The massive voter turnout in the CHP primary and the scale of the protests underscore his enduring appeal. If he is barred from contesting future elections, Mr. Erdo\u011fan may eliminate his most formidable rival, but at the cost of deepening political divisions and further eroding public faith in democratic institutions. At 71, Mr. Erdo\u011fan would do well to heed the voices in the streets, abandon the persecution of political challengers, and focus on addressing the economic crisis that his policies have helped create. T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s future hinges not just on who governs, but on whether its democracy can still offer a fair and open contest for power.

        "full_article": "By cracking down on opposition supporters Erdogan reinforces his image as an electoral autocrat\nErdogan is once again proving why T\u00fcrkiye often gets described as an electoral autocracy. Although presidential elections in T\u00fcrkiye are a couple of years away \u2013 there\u2019s chatter about early polls \u2013 the long-time Turkish leader appears to be putting obstacles in the path of his potential political opponent. And that challenger is the hugely popular Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu from the opposition Republican People\u2019s Party. Imamoglu was detained and arrested last week over alleged corruption charges \u2013 which he describes as fabricated \u2013 leading to days of widespread protests. Turkish authorities have detained 1,133 people since March 19, making these the largest demonstrations since the 2013 Gezi uprising.\nBut such crackdowns have taken place periodically under Erdogan\u2019s two-decade-old leadership that has been marked by the vilification of opposition \u2013 whom Erdogan has often equated with terrorists \u2013 purges of critics, and malleability of democratic institutions. Even in the last Turkish presidential polls in 2023, Erdogan employed divisive rhetoric and labelled his then main rival Kemal Kilicdaroglu as being pro-LGBTQ and hand in glove with terrorists.\nAll of these are classic tactics of an electoral autocrat for whom winning polls by any means necessary is more important than upholding the values and sanctity of democratic institutions. But in Imamoglu \u2013 who has been nominated as his party\u2019s presidential candidate \u2013 Erdogan may face his toughest challenge yet. There are clear parallels between the two \u2013 Erdogan was also once Istanbul mayor before being arrested and then going on to dominate Turkish national politics. But years of anti-incumbency may finally be crystallising against Erdogan and he may not be able to leverage T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s crucial geopolitical position to ward off international proscription. That may explain his recent surprising outreach to the Kurds \u2013 long victims of Ankara\u2019s policies. All of this also means that Erdogan fears being out of power, a hallmark of electoral autocrats.\u00a0\n\n",

        "full_article": "Funding cash handouts, especially the rash of schemes for women, is a recipe for fiscal emergency for states\nPresenting her debut budget, Delhi CM Rekha Gupta allocated Rs 5,100cr to fund women\u2019s cash scheme Rs 2,500 per month \u2013 a poll promise. This is less than half of what may be required to service beneficiaries of the scheme, estimated at 38L if beneficiaries are women whose household income is less than Rs 3L per annum. The budget already shows the strain of financing freebies \u2013 it includes dipping into small savings (NSSF) to the tune of Rs 15k cr. Last year, Union finance ministry had frowned upon such practice, saying it disrupts the broader borrowing framework. Kejriwal had proposed it in order to continue AAP govt\u2019s welfare schemes of free electricity etc.\nFact is, all states with similar cash transfers to women are under severe financial strain. From Maharashtra\u2019s BJP-led govt to Karnataka and Telangana\u2019s Congress govts, and former AAP govt in Delhi, finances of the richest states are stressed over polltime\u2019s unrestrained largesse. It\u2019s not about breaking promises \u2013 if poll promises were kept, India would\u2019ve been \u2018developed\u2019 by now. The issue is far more grave \u2013 freebie culture has no winners. Funding freebies will eventually make the state broke; not servicing the promise may have electoral fallout. In Maharashtra, since June 2024, fiscal deficit has nearly doubled from Rs 1.1L cr to Rs 2.2L cr. The state spent Rs 87k cr more than budget estimates 2024-25 \u2013 much of it to fund earlier Mahayuti govt\u2019s poll year sops. Both the women\u2019s handout scheme and the monthly stipend for jobless youth are costly affairs \u2013 but just placebos to dull the pain of jobless youth and destitute women.\nTelangana CM Revanth Reddy has admitted his state\u2019s financial crunch, that after paying salaries, pensions, debt and interest, most of the rest of the money \u2013 Rs 5k cr \u2013 goes to \u2018welfare\u2019. The state is left with almost nothing to spend on capex. RBI has cautioned that spend on sops could crowd out resources critical for social and economic infra. States don\u2019t have money to invest in creating public goods. Private investment is not an answer. GOI\u2019s capex levels are down. India can\u2019t upgrade unless its states invest in creating enabling economic conditions.\nKharge has called for state units to make only financially viable promises. Reddy recently called for all political parties to deliberate and arrive at a national consensus on such guarantees/freebies, in a bid to rationalise, move away from the ill-conceived practice. It is the need of the hour.\n\n",

That\u2019s the linguistic, if not the economic, question posed by Tamil Nadu\u2019s DMK govt having used the initial letter of the Tamil word for rupee, which is \u2018rubaai\u2019 or \u2018ru\u2019, instead of the Devanagari-based rupee symbol in its presentation of the state budget\u2019s logo.\nThe symbolic move is reportedly a retaliatory response to what is seen by Tamil Nadu to be the BJP-led central govt\u2019s attempt to foist Hindi as the lingual currency of the country onto the state through the three-language formula of the National Educational Policy.\nThe hoisting of the flag of linguistic revolt has provoked a sharp reaction from the Centre, with the finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, decrying it as a \u201ccompletely avoidable example of language and regional chauvinism\u201d.\nHowever, it\u2019s not just Tamil Nadu and other southern states that see Hindi as a stalking horse of the Centre in its bid to gain lingual dominance at the expense of regional autonomy as expressed through speech and script.\nWhat is increasingly seen as a forcible \u2018Hindification\u2019 of the country is viewed with suspicion by the other states, such as Bengal, which are justly proud of their rich linguistic heritage.\nThe Newtonian principle that every action has an equal and opposite reaction is applicable not only in the realm of physics, but also in the domain of cultural identity as expressed in the written and spoken word.\nIn the Bible story, a humankind united by a common language began building a Tower of Babel to reach heaven, a project which irked God who confounded humans by making them speak a multiplicity of tongues and thereby scattering them across the face of the Earth.\nThanks not to the Almighty, but to the lesser god of language politics, are we creating our own lingual Babel to sunder our unity?\nAs a preventive stratagem we might adopt a one-language formula based on a single, region-neutral, politics-neutral lingua franca.

Despite gaining this duty holiday in 2020, we have not been able to increase our exports to China compared to our imports from the country of 1.4 billion people. Initially, duty-free access to Chinese markets was offered to 8,547 Bangladeshi products; later, 100 percent duty-free access was given to all products from Bangladesh. Yet, during the July-December period of the current fiscal year, Bangladesh only exported $0.46 billion worth of goods to China while importing $8.89 billion worth of goods. In the last six fiscal years, trade differences with China, in fact, went up.\nIn the past, we received zero-tariff benefits from India. There too, we failed to take full advantage of the benefit, and our trade imbalance with the country remained high. Both these instances point to our lack of productivity, failure to increase industrial capacity, and inability to attract investment in our export-oriented businesses (other than ready-made garments). Interestingly, Bangladesh's main export to China is garments, even though China itself is the world's largest apparel exporter. According to a report in this daily, Bangladesh does not have much scope to increase apparel exports to China beyond what is currently being done. This shows a lack of vision regarding product diversification, with the export sector largely remaining stuck in RMG.\nExperts told this daily that we should have pursued Chinese investments in products such as man-made fibre, leather, leather goods, solar panels, semiconductors, and microchips, which could be exported back to China. However, our policies often lack comprehensive implementation plans. Moreover, corruption and negligence often derail implementation. Inconsistent policies, high energy prices, and lack of political stability also drive away foreign investors.\nAs Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus is set to visit China, we must assess our performance in taking comprehensive steps to increase our export basket and attract Chinese investment. US President Donald Trump's trade war against several countries, including China, has opened some doors of opportunity for Bangladesh. Chinese investors are showing interest, and we must hit the iron while it's hot. We cannot let this opportunity slip because of our internal problems, low productivity, and lack of political consensus needed for urgent reforms that can support a trade-conducive and investment-friendly environment.\n",

        "full_article": "Back in our school days, we learnt about history and many historical landmarks in the classroom from our textbooks. There used to be beautiful pictures of historical places like Egypt's pyramids or the Roman Colosseum. We often wondered what it would feel like if we could walk through those places and see them in reality. But cost and distance made such visits unattainable for most of us. These historic wonders remained confined to our imaginations and the printed pages, leaving us to dream of a reality beyond our reach. Once bound by imagination, these childhood dreams are now much closer to reality through the wonders of virtual reality (VR). Students today can explore these historical landmarks as if they were physically there.\nVR creates an immersive three-dimensional environment. It was conceptualised in 1965 with a visionary idea\u2014\"The Ultimate Display\"\u2014by Ivan Sutherland, and the term \"virtual reality\" was coined in 1987 by Jaron Lanier, who is often considered the father of VR.\nThe technology is no longer confined to virtual tours of historical landmarks. Its application is rapidly expanding across diverse fields of education, transforming the learning experience like never before. I believe this is an invention comparable to the mobile phone. Mobile phones were initially invented to enable people to communicate over long distances without any wired connection\u2014a true revolution. But now, what isn't there in a mobile phone? People are getting countless benefits from it in various forms. Similarly, VR is no longer just about immersive environments, its scope has expanded across many fields.\nVR provides innovative solutions to the challenges in traditional education. One of the most notable advancements is the rise of virtual labs. These labs are now used in schools worldwide, enabling students to conduct practical experiments without physical lab equipment. Nowadays, complex experiments in physics and chemistry can be simulated using VR. Students can now visualise molecular structures with it. Another significant advantage is that chemical reactions can be simulated in a safe virtual environment, enabling students to learn without risks. Architecture students can now create and visualise 3D structures using tools like Autodesk VR. Additionally, universities around the world are easily using VR to show their students notable architectural landmarks, along with their construction techniques and designs.\nA significant use of VR has also emerged in the medical sector. Anatomy is being taught through VR by showing 3D models. A risk-free immersive environment is being created using virtual reality to develop surgical skills of medical professionals and to provide training for complex operations.\nMany schools take their students to museums and historical places using VR. Westminster Law School in the UK introduced a virtual reality game back in 2016 to teach students criminal law by allowing them to experience murder scenes through VR. During the pandemic, a professor at the University of North Carolina sent VR headsets to students and built a virtual classroom to conduct classes.\nThe University of Rhode Island's College of Pharmacy has developed a VR lab for high school students to conduct virtual experiments on medicinal plants. On the other hand, online platforms like VRLab Academy provide hundreds of science experiments for VR users.\nMany universities in Bangladesh are also incorporating VR into education, particularly in fields like architecture and history. Some institutions have established specialised VR labs to support research, while companies like Nerdiz have introduced VR kits in schools, enabling students to explore historical sites virtually.\nBeyond higher education, VR can bridge the urban-rural education gap by bringing virtual science labs, historical site tours, and vocational training to schools and training institutes. Affordable VR kits, public-private partnerships, and government-backed initiatives can ensure that students, regardless of location, have access to these advanced learning tools. Mobile VR classrooms could also be deployed to underserved regions, providing equal learning opportunities across the country.\nTo make VR a reality in Bangladesh's education system, localised content development and strategic collaborations with edtech startups, universities, and global tech firms are essential. The government and private sectors must invest in infrastructure and training to integrate VR into classrooms effectively.\nVirtual reality is no longer a futuristic dream; it is here, revolutionising education across the world, and Bangladesh must not stay behind. The question is no longer if we should embrace VR in education, but how soon we can make it a reality.\nMd Rakib Hasan is director of IT (additional charge) at Southeast University.

        "full_article": "Henry Kissinger, one of the most influential yet controversial political figures of the 20th century, passed away in 2023, leaving behind a legacy that continues to spark heated debates. Lauded by some as a master of diplomacy and realpolitik, he remains, in the eyes of others, a war criminal who should have been held accountable for his actions. In\u00a0The Trial of Henry Kissinger, Christopher Hitchens meticulously builds a case against Kissinger, arguing that his policies and decisions\u2014from his role in extending the Vietnam War to his backing of right-wing coups, complicity in genocide, and orchestration of covert operations\u2014led to mass suffering across the globe. The Bangladesh chapter of the book is particularly damning, exposing the cold indifference and realpolitik calculations that led to one of the most horrifying atrocities of the 20th century.\nIn December 1970, the people of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) overwhelmingly voted for self-rule under the leadership of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the Awami League. However, instead of honouring the democratic mandate, the Pakistani military, led by General Yahya Khan, launched Operation Searchlight on March 25, 1971. What followed was an unrelenting campaign of mass killings, systematic sexual violence, and forced displacement. Conservative estimates place the death toll at 300,000, though many argue the real number was closer to three million.\nAs reports of massacres spread, one of the earliest and most powerful condemnations came from Archer Kent Blood, the US Consul General in Dhaka. Blood and his team sent a series of telegrams to Washington detailing the atrocities being committed by the Pakistani military. In the telegrams, they pleaded the US to take a stand against the Pakistani government. The message read:\n\"Our government has failed to denounce the suppression of democracy. Our government has failed to denounce atrocities\u2026Our government has evidenced what many will consider moral bankruptcy...\"\nThis was signed by dozens of diplomats, making it the strongest internal protest ever recorded within the US State Department. Yet, Nixon and Kissinger dismissed it outright. Kissinger, obsessed with using Pakistan as a backchannel to China, saw Yahya Khan as an indispensable ally. Instead of acting against genocide, Kissinger chose silence and complicity. In fact, the US government, under Kissinger's guidance, actively supported the Pakistani military by supplying them with weapons.\nKissinger also made a callous remark in a private conversation, referring to Bangladesh as a \"basket case,\" illustrating his dismissive attitude toward the country's plight and people. Between March and December 1971, the Pakistani military conducted some of the most gruesome acts of ethnic and political cleansing of the 20th century. Bangalee intellectuals were specifically targeted and executed, Hindu minorities were slaughtered, and millions of women were subjected to rape as a weapon of war. While the world condemned the atrocities, Nixon and Kissinger continued to stand by Pakistan.\nHis secret conversations with Nixon reveal racist and derogatory remarks about Bangalees and Indians, showing his complete disregard for human lives. Even when the then US Ambassador Kenneth Keating urged the administration to publicly condemn Pakistan's brutality, Nixon said to Kissinger that Keating had been \"taken over by the Indians.\" Kissinger, for his part, at the height of the genocide in late April sent Yahya a message praising him for \"delicacy and tact.\"\nAs the crisis deepened, India, overwhelmed by millions of Bangalee refugees, prepared to intervene militarily. On December 3, 1971, India officially entered the war to assist the Mukti Bahini. In response, Kissinger orchestrated a dangerous and reckless move. He deployed the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise into the Bay of Bengal. This was meant to intimidate India and deter its intervention, but it failed.\nMukti Bahini with help from India swiftly defeated Pakistan, leading to the creation of an independent Bangladesh on December 16, 1971. But Kissinger's hostility toward Bangladesh did not end there.\nWhen Mujib sought international recognition and aid for the war-ravaged country, the US remained distant. Kissinger saw Mujib's government as an embarrassment, resenting the exposure of US complicity in genocide. In November 1974, Kissinger made a brief eight-hour visit to Dhaka, where he refused to acknowledge the role of the US in Pakistan's actions.\nHitchens' book meticulously builds a case against Kissinger, arguing that his actions in Bangladesh, Chile, Vietnam, and East Timor amount to war crimes. Kissinger's secret involvement in overthrowing democratically elected leaders, his orchestration of military coups, and his support for genocidal regimes paint the picture of a man who viewed human lives as collateral damage in his grand strategy. As Bangladesh continues to push for global recognition of the 1971 genocide, the question remains: will history hold Kissinger accountable, or will his crimes fade into the shadows of realpolitik?\nKollol Kibria\u00a0is an advocate, human rights activist, and political analyst.
