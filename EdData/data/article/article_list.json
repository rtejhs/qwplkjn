Cybercriminals have exploited a security gap wherein user accounts on instant messaging apps remain functional even after the associated SIM card has been removed, using this anonymity to conduct government impersonation fraud. The rampant use of spoofed or tampered IMEI numbers has also made tracking perpetrators nearly impossible for law enforcement. It is perhaps inevitable that the government seeks sharper tools to address these software and hardware vulnerabilities, which explains the Department of Telecommunications\u2019 directives on November 28 and December 1. The first mandates \u201cSIM binding\u201d \u2014 ensuring that a user\u2019s account is disabled if the physical SIM is removed. In the second, smartphone manufacturers must pre-install the Sanchar Saathi app to verify device authenticity in all new devices by March 2026. While the first directive is a security patch which could inconvenience WhatsApp/Internet messaging users, the second is reminiscent of the saying, the road to hell is often paved with good intentions. The solution to the problem of counterfeit handsets and spoofed IMEI numbers is a cure that could potentially be more damaging than the disease.The explicit instruction in the directive that the app is \u201creadily visible and accessible to the end users at the time of first use or device setup and that its functionalities are not disabled or restricted\u201d would mean that this app will be given a higher security clearance within the phone\u2019s operating system, allowing it more intrusive access to features such as camera, phone or SMS access. The potential for misuse of this app for state surveillance and being utilised by a malicious entity after compromise to target millions of users is very present and clear. This is no empty fear considering what the Union government has done with the use of Pegasus software to target the political opposition, journalists and activists. Notwithstanding Union Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia\u2019s clarification that users could delete the app, the directive\u2019s text mandating that it cannot be disabled suggests that it will function more as a Panopticon and less as a simple verification tool. As the Supreme Court\u2019s K.S. Puttaswamy (2017) judgment established, any state intrusion into privacy must satisfy the tests of legality, necessity, and proportionality. The government already possesses less intrusive means to verify device genuineness. The Sanchar Saathi web portals, SMS-based checks, and USSD codes should suffice. By ignoring these less invasive alternatives, the directive on Sanchar Saathi fails the proportionality standard. It is little wonder that privacy-conscious manufacturers such as Apple have reportedly refused to comply with this order.

        "full_article": "The last few days have shown just what a roller coaster of a ride India\u2019s economic data can take. Last Friday\u2019s robust Q2 GDP growth, a six-quarter high of 8.2%, lifted the government\u2019s mood and brought cheer to its supporters. The relatively low nominal growth rate and grade by the IMF did little to dampen this feeling. However, the latest data on the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) and, to an extent, the manufacturing PMI are likely to do more in that regard. The IIP\u2019s growth in October 2025 was just 0.4%, a 14-month low. While the GDP data for the July-September quarter showed the manufacturing sector growing 9.1%, the IIP showed the sector had slowed to a 14-month low of 1.8% in October. One of the possible reasons for this is that the GDP growth rate was boosted by a low base, since the sector had grown just 2.2% in the July-September 2024 quarter. The other, more troubling reason, is the impact of the U.S.\u2019s tariffs. Merchandise exports grew in September, the first full month of 50% tariffs, as earlier orders were being fulfilled. They then contracted nearly 12% in October as the tariffs began to weigh on new order decisions. The PMI data, too, showed that the score for India\u2019s manufacturing sector stood at a nine-month low of 56.6 in November. The report specifically mentioned that new export orders rose at their slowest pace in over a year, another sign that the U.S.\u2019s tariffs were hurting.While subdued exports likely weighed on the manufacturing sector, the change in weather towards winter and prolonged rains pulled down the electricity and mining sectors, respectively. As a result, the primary goods sector contracted in October. The GDP data had shown that investment had grown by a reasonably strong 7.3% in Q2. However, the IIP data suggest this could have slowed in the beginning of Q3 with the capital goods sector growing at a 14-month low of 2.4%. The IIP data also have some concerning news regarding household consumption. The GDP data showed that Private Final Consumption Expenditure grew at nearly 8% in Q2. However, the IIP showed that the consumer durables and non-durables sectors contracted in October, in aggregate their worst performance in two years. This was the first full month of data following the GST rate rationalisation. GST revenue of \u20b91.7 lakh crore in November, reflecting economic activity in October, also shows that demand did not come rushing in as fast as the government would have liked. Taken together, multiple initial metrics are indicating that Q3 is not likely to be a cheerful quarter for the economy.

        "full_article": "Personality, prosperity, destiny \u2013 number plate says it all\nNumbers once lived quiet lives on calculators and report cards. Now, they ride proudly on bonnets and bumpers, announcing identity with more conviction than any business card or biography. Every civilisation eventually finds a new altar at which to worship. Once it was fire, then it was gold, later it became Wi-Fi, and now, in our endlessly inventive India, it is the humble number plate. What was once the ID of the car has now become the identity of the individual. A number now does not merely identify your vehicle. It interprets your personality, your prosperity, and possibly your karmic horoscope.\nLast week, this worship reached its zenith when HR 88 B 8888 sold for a gravity-defying \u20b91.17cr. There was a time when a number mattered only in two scenarios: exam results and cricket scores. A \u2018lucky number\u2019 meant wearing jersey No. 9 to the cricket stadium or buying a ticket ending in 3. Today, however, the number has ascended to a plane once reserved for gurus, gemstones, and IPO listings.\nWhy this zeal for digits? Because we have always been a nation that believes numbers tell stories of luck, of lineage, of latent potential. The only surprise is that it took us until 2025 to realise that these sacred symbols could also tell the world our net worth.\n8888 is so symmetrical it could calm a raging algorithm. Numerologists insist that 8 radiates power, ambition, and prosperity. Sceptics note it also resembles two neatly stacked laddus. Either way, India is merely joining a global pilgrimage. Dubai auctions plates for sums exceeding \u20b9120cr. Countries with mature vanity-plate cultures, like UAE and UK, treat plates as collectible assets. But India adds something uniquely its own: numerology, aspiration, sentiment, and a faint hope that symmetry might soften destiny.\nIn the end, perhaps a \u20b91.17cr number plate says less about extravagance and more about evolution. The world changes; status symbols shift; aspirations adapt. And as long as humans crave meaning, we will continue to find it in stars, in symbols, and now, in sequences of eights. And in a country where we refuse to start a journey without checking the muhurat, why wouldn\u2019t we want destiny engraved on metal? So, the next time you see a car glide past bearing a number that looks more curated than a museum exhibit, remember: it isn\u2019t showing off. It is simply expressing its numerological truth.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Elon\u2019s post-work fantasy puts him in the company of Marx. Like him, he won\u2019t see it come true\u00a0\nIf the world\u2019s richest man is right, your infant child won\u2019t ever need to work. Even better, she won\u2019t pester you for pocket money. School, doctor\u2019s visits, travel, destination wedding, everything will be on the house. He says money will become irrelevant in the not-too-distant future, and \u201cpeople will have any goods and services they want\u201d. Elon Musk is so sure this will happen that he\u2019s declared it twice in a fortnight \u2013 at the US-Saudi Investment Forum on Nov 19, and then in a podcast released on Sunday.\nHow is it possible? Musk is counting on AI and robots to do everything \u2013 \u201cin less than 20 years, maybe even 10\u201d \u2013 so that humans can vegetate or luxuriate, per their taste. It\u2019s indeed brave of him to say so, considering that money could be going out of fashion just when his $1tn performance-linked package vests. But, in all likelihood, this idea, which stems from the late Iain M Banks\u2019 science fantasy novels, will remain that \u2013 a fantasy.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s because money is an excellent invention. It prevents Musk\u2019s \u201cIf you can think of it, you can have it\u201d vision from coming true. Imagine, if wishes became horses, where would we pasture them, and who would sweep the manure? Everyone would want natural diamonds, private jets, seaside villas, and Bond cars, while poor old Bond, who turned 105 last month, grumbles, \u201cthe world is not enough\u201d .\nIf money is good, so is work. Philosophically, it\u2019s what gives life purpose. Practically, it\u2019s what brings home money. Personally, it\u2019s vital for human connection. Musk himself used to swear by the 80-100-hour workweek, why is he keen to deprive others of the \u201cpleasure\u201d? Society itself is built around work. Modern education is structured around it. If humans don\u2019t work at all, we\u2019ll all \u2013 Musk included \u2013 be living in AI\u2019s zoo. AI will plan for us, police us, judge us. But if some humans remain in charge of AI, they\u2019ll be more powerful than the most powerful emperor in history.\u00a0\nWe don\u2019t want that. Together, work and money are the foundation of a fair society. Yes, the link between them is broken now, but removing them is not the solution. Musk should know that Marx was his fantasy\u2019s grandfather, and Keynes a loving uncle. Not the camp he wants to be seen in. What he wants is to sell lots of Optimus robots \u2013 to make up 80% of Tesla\u2019s value \u2013 and for that his fantasy is a good sales pitch.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Telangana forest officials help defend a nest, reminding everyone that birds labour no less than us\u00a0\nThe owl of Minerva spreads its wings only with the coming of dusk, said Hegel two centuries ago. What did he mean? Perhaps that human understanding comes too late. Consider, for example, how mindlessly we are driving animals to exile, excruciating pain and extinction. Any regrets we have, are already too late for too many species. But others can yet benefit from our compassion and conscience. And every human being can make a difference. As a Rock Eagle Owl family nesting at a stone quarry in Yenakathala village, Telangana, has recently experienced. No sooner had the incubating parent been spotted that images, location details, and a proper chain of actions got underway. Quarrying has been halted. State forest officials say it will only resume after the owlets are hatched, grow and move away from the area.\nBesides empathy, the rescue was enabled by knowledge. The raptors wouldn\u2019t live in a relocated nest. As easy are owls to recognise, they are much harder to see, and their behaviours even harder to learn. Their camouflage takes a lot of diligence to crack. It takes stillness, the ability to just sit, look, and listen. Those who have done so have described the complex owl processes of selecting mate and nest, and raising owlets, which ornithologist Jennifer Ackerman documents in What an Owl Knows. Manmade nest boxes, she underlines, are no substitute for the dynamic environment offered by a tree hollow, or other natural cavities.\u00a0\nLoss of their native habitats remains the single greatest threat to owl populations. Yes, they are adapting to us and to urbanisation. But if the world humans have made is seeing their own birth rates decline, its impact on animal breeding patterns is far more acute. Owls lose up to a third of their body weight to nest their family. Let\u2019s not act like their labour is less than ours. \n\n",

        "full_article": "The devastating consequences of salinity on the lives and livelihoods of people in the coastal areas are well known. A recent investigation by\u00a0The Daily Star\u00a0has revealed an equally alarming and often-overlooked dimension of this crisis: its brutal toll on women's health. Across Khulna and Satkhira, women are suffering from severe reproductive and skin-related conditions that are altering the course of their lives, ushering in early menopause, forcing hysterectomies, and increasing the risk of cancer. Many endure chronic infections in silence, often left untreated for years due to stigma, poor access to healthcare services, or geographical inaccessibility.\nWomen engaged in shrimp farming spend hours standing waist-deep in saline water to catch shrimp fry to support their families. They drink salty water, wash and bathe with it, and work in it daily. The results are chronic skin diseases, urinary tract infections, and serious reproductive health complications. This is also supported by recent data. According to a 2024 Journal of Migration and Health study, 64.8 percent of women in Mongla and 53.8 percent in Shyamnagar, Satkhira, reported inflammation or infections of the vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes or ovaries. Nearly one-third struggle to maintain menstrual hygiene. Severe skin problems affect 92 percent of women in Shyamnagar and nearly 70 percent in Mongla.\nAn icddr,b analysis covering 2012-2017 further showed that women living near the coastline face a 1.3 times higher risk of miscarriage than those in higher-elevation areas. Hypertension, exacerbated by salinity, is quite common, increasing the likelihood of pre-eclampsia in pregnant women. Despite these problems, however, successive governments have ignored the crisis of salinity in coastal areas. Unregulated shrimp farming has contaminated soil and water, devastated agricultural land, and made safe drinking water increasingly scarce. The health fallout\u2014especially for women and girls\u2014has now become impossible to overlook.\nWe urge the authorities to treat this as a public health emergency. While long-term policy reforms, including strict regulation of shrimp farming, are essential, immediate interventions cannot wait. Access to safe drinking water and sanitation must be ensured through investments in rainwater harvesting, desalination technologies, and other measures, prioritising the most affected areas. Health services must also be expanded in remote areas by establishing mobile clinics, deploying more female health workers, and subsidising diagnostic and reproductive health services. Large-scale awareness must be launched on the risks of prolonged saline exposure, the importance of hygiene, and the need to seek timely medical attention. It is equally important that, besides government authorities, political parties too help in addressing salinity as both a development and public health priority in these regions.\n",

Obviously, those were projected as the measure of the nation's development. Even the international development partners were convinced of those growth narratives and would praise the then-government for its success story of economic growth. Against this backdrop, economists have of late been coming up with research data that are unravelling the mismatch between growth, for instance, in the manufacturing sector and the rising rate of unemployment. Presented at a recently held discussion event styled \"Beyond Jobless Growth: Towards an Employment-Centred Policy Framework for Bangladesh Through a Post-Neoliberal Lens\", some study findings showed that the manufacturing sector despite recording an impressive annual rate of growth at around 10 per cent between 2013 and 2023, had shed 1.4 million jobs during that period. How can one explain this glaring mismatch between growth and unemployment at the same time? \nIt was found that in the export-oriented garment industry, fewer workers produced more value in terms of export earnings than before. In 2013, for instance, the industry required 220 workers to produce goods worth US$1.0 million in terms of export earnings. However, a decade later in 2024, the same amount of goods and matching export earnings could be generated by 94 workers. That was definitely good news for the investors who achieved such success through adoption of modern technology that increased productivity of the industry manifold, but at a cost. While one cannot deny the industry's higher level of productivity and earnings that go with it, but at the same time it creates a fresh crisis for the policymakers resulting from the massive job cuts. How can these dichotomous developments in the macro-economy be reconciled? Growth is no doubt a priority before the investors in the manufacturing industries such as the export-driven ones, but the question that would also arise at the same time is, growth for whom? And this issue is especially problematic for a country where about 3.0 million people are entering the job market annually. So, creating jobs for the fresh millions joining the workforce every year should be the topmost priority before the government as well as the development thinkers. \nUnsurprisingly, some experts at the said discussion event blamed the deepening employment crisis on what they termed disproportionate focus on a single industrial sector, namely, the Readymade Garment (RMG). This, no doubt, created an imbalance affecting the rest of the economy. For when the RMG-led manufacturing has been experiencing significant rise in terms of growth, the agriculture that absorbs the overwhelming proportion of the growing workforce went through a decline as its contribution to the GDP fell markedly from its previous level. This calls for incentivising more agro-based industries including the start-ups in the sector. That may help reduce the job loss on a massive scale like the manufacturing sector suffered over the last one decade. \nOverall, it is time for a rethink on the part of both the government and the economic expert about getting the priorities for growth and employment right. While the economists are rightly blaming government policies and explaining the existing economic realities through different terminologies such as 'triangle of vicious cycles' and so on, the real challenge would be to come up with the correct guidelines for the policymakers and the businesses to follow. It goes without saying that the right model for the economic growth should be the one that creates more jobs and ensures growth at the same time.\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "full_article": "\n / EDITORIAL\n   Wasi Ahmed   |  \n       December 03, 2025 00:00:00  \nBangladesh's trade imbalance with China has continued to rise over the past decade, driven mainly by high imports of industrial goods from its single largest source. While Bangladesh's export earnings from China have remained largely stagnant despite enjoying duty-free access for 98 per cent of its tariff lines, imports have surged to fuel local manufacturing, infrastructure building and industrial expansion. This widening gap has inevitably raised a pressing question: why has Bangladesh been unable to capitalise on its almost fully duty-free status in the vast Chinese market?\nThe answer, however, is more complex than it appears at first glance. The link between export performance and duty-free access is far from linear. Market entry-even with tariff advantages-depends on a range of factors that go beyond trade preferences. A closer look at Bangladesh-China trade dynamics helps illuminate the structural realities shaping this outcome.\nAt present, China accounts for roughly 22 per cent of Bangladesh's total imports, dominating the supply of industrial raw materials, intermediate goods, chemicals, fabrics, yarn, accessories, and capital machinery. This heavy import footprint has, over the years, created a deep industrial reliance on Chinese inputs, which traders and analysts say is driven by competitive pricing, consistent quality and reliable availability. From textiles to electronics, leather to construction, Bangladeshi industries depend heavily on Chinese supply lines to keep production running.\nCentral bank statistics covering FY2019-20 to the first quarter of FY2025-26 show how significantly Bangladesh's import bills from China have outpaced its export receipts. Imports ranged between US$ 11 billion and US$ 20 billion annually, while exports remained confined to around US$ 500-600 million. Imports rose sharply from US$11.49 billion in FY20 to a historic peak of US$ 20.88 billion in FY22, supported by strong domestic manufacturing growth and major infrastructure projects. However, the trend reversed as macroeconomic pressures mounted. Foreign exchange shortages, currency depreciation, and subdued industrial activity pushed imports down to US$ 17.83 billion in FY23 and US$16.64 billion in FY24. The cautious stance continued in FY25, with import LC openings registering US$ 15.48 billion. During the first quarter of FY26, imports stood at US$ 4.04 billion, reflecting restrained industrial demand and a more conservative purchasing outlook.\nIn stark contrast, Bangladesh's exports to China have shown minimal movement over the same period. Yearly export earnings fluctuated mildly: US$ 595.39 million in FY20, US$ 680.50 million in FY21, US$ 674.62 million in FY22, before dipping to US$ 580.40 million in FY23 and then rising modestly to around US$ 670 million in FY24 and FY25. In the first quarter of FY26, exports reached US$ 190.89 million-consistent with past patterns, but nowhere near the scale required to narrow the deficit meaningfully.\nThis stagnation persists despite China's duty-free access for 98 per cent of Bangladeshi products. Tariff concessions alone cannot overcome the deeper structural challenges that constrain Bangladesh's export capacity. Several factors lie behind this limited utilisation of market access.\nFirst, Bangladesh's export basket remains narrow. The country relies overwhelmingly on ready-made garments (RMG), a sector in which China itself is a global manufacturing powerhouse. Competing in China's domestic apparel market is very difficult, given its scale, cost efficiency and advanced industrial ecosystem. Beyond garments, Bangladesh has yet to develop diversified, high-value products that resonate with China's evolving consumption patterns.\nSecond, supply-side constraints weigh heavily on export performance. Bangladeshi firms face limitations in production capacity, quality consistency, product design, and technological sophistication-areas where China excels. Logistics, port efficiency, customs procedures, and transport systems in Bangladesh remain significantly behind Chinese standards, limiting the speed and reliability required for export-oriented supply chains.\nThird, Bangladesh has struggled to leverage duty-free access effectively. Without diversified products and strong supply capabilities, preferential tariff access alone cannot stimulate a meaningful increase in exports. Many Bangladeshi firms lack the market intelligence, branding strength, compliance readiness, and long-term export strategies needed to enter and sustain operations in a competitive market like China.\nFourth, there is a clear mismatch between Bangladeshi export offerings and Chinese market demand. China's import preferences have shifted towards higher-value items-technology-infused apparel, specialised textiles, high-grade agro-products, electronics components, machinery parts and advanced materials. Bangladesh is yet to build competitive capacity in these sectors.\nFifth, China's domestic supply chains are exceptionally strong. With efficient manufacturing clusters, cheap logistics, and economies of scale, Chinese producers enjoy inherent advantages. Even when Bangladeshi products enter the market duty-free, competing against China's own low-cost producers becomes extremely challenging.\nAdding to these structural barriers are domestic challenges. Political instability, business uncertainty and periodic disruptions in transportation and logistics exacerbate export constraints. Investors-both domestic and foreign-often prefer to maintain a cautious stance, slowing down capital formation in industries that could otherwise diversify Bangladesh's export base.\nExperts note that the Bangladesh-China trade imbalance reflects more than just a numerical deficit-it is symptomatic of deeper industrial dependence. Currently, 30-35 per cent of Bangladesh's industrial raw materials and machinery originate from China. This reliance, while difficult to avoid given pricing advantages, makes it harder for Bangladesh to build a competitive manufacturing base capable of producing a broader array of exportable goods.\nTo reduce the imbalance in the long term, Bangladesh must diversify its sourcing network, encourage local backward-linkage industries and upgrade manufacturing capacities. At the same time, developing new export-oriented sectors-IT services, agro-processed goods, pharmaceuticals, specialised textiles, light engineering and leather goods-can help tap into China's vast and dynamic market.\nwasiahmed.bd@gmail.com\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The short-video format has unlocked new avenues for creativity, giving young people the freedom to showcase talent, share opinions and connect with a wider audience. From dance clips and comedy sketches to educational content and social awareness campaigns, TikTok has expanded the possibilities of digital self-expression for the country's younger generation.\nOne of TikTok's most notable contributions is the way it encourages creativity and confidence. Thousands of young Bangladeshis, many from outside major cities, have found a platform where they can express their identity without the need for expensive equipment or professional training. \nHowever, alongside these positive developments, the rise of TikTok culture has introduced several concerning trends. Through TikTok, many people are now creating fake content and spreading a lot of fake news, causing ordinary people to suffer. The pressure to gain followers and likes often leads young users to imitate risky behaviours, follow viral challenges without considering consequences, or engage in unhealthy competition. Excessive screen time has become a growing issue, affecting sleep, productivity and academic performance for many students. \nAnother worrying aspect is the spread of misinformation and sensational content designed solely to attract views. Without proper media literacy, many young people find it difficult to distinguish reliable information from online exaggeration, making them vulnerable to manipulation. At the same time, the commercialisation of TikTok fame can sometimes promote unrealistic expectations, where success is measured only through virtual popularity.\n Balancing these opportunities and risks is essential as TikTok continues to grow in Bangladesh. Parents, educators, and policymakers must work together to promote responsible digital use by encouraging media literacy and creating awareness about online safety. At the same time, TikTok itself can play a positive role by strengthening content moderation, promoting educational creators, and highlighting responsible trends. For Bangladeshi youth, the challenge is to embrace the platform's innovative potential while staying mindful of its adverse impacts.\nAhmed Abdullah Rafi, Student\nDepartment of Marketing\nNorth South University.\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

They support millions of jobs, promote local entrepreneurship, and contribute to balanced regional growth. As the country aims for long-term economic advancement, the SME sector continues to play a central role in ensuring inclusive and sustainable progress.\nHowever, the growth of SMEs is often limited by several structural challenges. Many entrepreneurs face difficulty accessing finance due to strict collateral requirements, complex loan procedures and limited awareness of financial opportunities. In addition, the slow adoption of modern technology and digital tools has reduced the competitiveness of small businesses in a growing digital marketplace. Without proper support, SMEs struggle to reach broader markets or improve productivity.\nTo strengthen this vital sector, coordinated action from the government, financial institutions and private organisations is essential. Simplifying loan processes, expanding SME-friendly financial products, and enhancing digital literacy and business training programmes can significantly improve the business environment. Public-private partnerships can also help build stronger supply chains and create additional market opportunities. A more resilient SME ecosystem will support employment, innovation, and long-term economic growth in Bangladesh.\nHabiba Sikder\nDhaka\nhabibasikder01@gmail.com\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
