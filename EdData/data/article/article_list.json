State Chief Minister M.K. Stalin has convened a meeting of legislature party leaders on April 9 to strategise the next move. With the admission season approaching, the development is bound to cause uncertainty and make medical aspirants anxious. Exemption from NEET now remains an inconclusive chapter in the State\u2019s decade-old policy discourse. No other State effort to legislate against a central mandate has been so protracted and unpredictable. In September 2017, two anti-NEET Bills met with a similar fate in Rashtrapati Bhavan. Four years later, the ruling DMK \u2014 having made NEET exemption a central electoral promise \u2014 passed the Bill in the Assembly based on the recommendations of the Justice A.K. Rajan Committee. Instead of forwarding it for presidential assent, Governor R.N. Ravi returned it to the House after five months. In a historic first, the Assembly unanimously re-adopted the Bill and sent it back to him; the Governor subsequently forwarded it to the President. Last week, Mr. Stalin informed the Assembly that assent had been denied, without specifying when Rashtrapati Bhavan had communicated the decision.This delay in the matter attaining finality is concerning as students have been left facing a state of perpetual uncertainty. The State remains firm in its policy of conducting admission for government quota medical seats based on the Class 12 Board examination scores. Early on, the Ministry of Home Affairs had asked \u201cwhether the Bill endangered the sovereignty, unity and integrity of the nation\u201d to which the AYUSH Ministry responded affirmatively. The framers of the Constitution had incorporated Article 254 (2) empowering the President to grant assent to Bills repugnant to central laws on Concurrent List matters. NEET has been consistently upheld by the Supreme Court of India too. The President is under no obligation to give assent, although the Bill reflects the collective will of Tamil Nadu\u2019s legislature: it was passed unanimously. True, NEET is neither foolproof nor an absolute measure of academic competency, but Tamil Nadu\u2019s legal options are limited. The judiciary is unlikely to settle the issue with any urgency. The State must prepare for a legal struggle, and in the interim, coach students to face NEET with confidence.

        "full_article": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to Sri Lanka, (April 4-6), his first after 2019, demonstrated, beyond optics, the close ties between the two countries. Colombo, under the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP)-led National People\u2019s Power (NPP) regime, is serious about improving relations with New Delhi. This was evident from the conferment of its highest honour for foreign leaders on Mr. Modi and a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on defence cooperation, billed as the first of its kind in bilateral ties. The JVP\u2019s ascension to power, following Anura Kumara Dissanayake\u2019s victory in the presidential poll in September 2024, and the NPP\u2019s resounding parliamentary election victory two months later, gave room to the perception that there would be a strictly formal, if not cold, relationship with India, given the JVP\u2019s anti-India posture of the past. There was also apprehension that Colombo might not be sensitive to New Delhi\u2019s security concerns. However, to be fair to him, Mr. Dissanayake reiterated his country\u2019s long-standing position that Sri Lanka would not permit its territory to be used against India\u2019s security and regional stability. Mr. Modi captured the rationale behind the MoU by saying that \u201cthe security of both countries is interconnected and co-dependent\u201d. Even though the MoU may have formalised certain arrangements in the area of defence, bilaterally, it is up to the NPP regime to establish that Sri Lanka means business in defence cooperation. But still, Sri Lanka is sure to be conscious that an understanding in 1987 not to let Trincomalee or any other Sri Lankan port be used for military purposes by a third country against India has not helped dispel India\u2019s concerns.On the vexatious fishermen\u2019s issue \u2014 one of importance to Tamil Nadu \u2014 it was a good sign that there were detailed discussions. But Mr. Modi\u2019s visit should trigger a full-fledged discussion between the fishing communities of the two countries, and one that is overseen by government officials. Recently, fishers on either side of the Palk Bay met and exchanged their views. If this meeting is to have some meaning, it should be followed up with another round of talks. A flexible approach will help create a lasting solution. Another significant outcome of the visit is that Tamil parties, in their meeting with Mr. Modi, conveyed the point that they recognised the significance of the Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987 in pursuit of achieving a political settlement for the Tamils and sought India\u2019s \u201clegitimate involvement\u201d. There has been criticism even in Sri Lanka that many of the parties had not fully supported the Accord, which paved the way for the establishment of provincial councils as a measure of devolution. New Delhi, which can provide liberal economic aid for the war-torn Northern and Eastern provinces, should play the role of a dispassionate observer and urge every stakeholder to pursue democratic means to arrive at a consensus.

        "full_article": "By- Shailendra Pandey\n\nAnant Ambani, 29, concluded a 170km padayatra from Jamnagar, his ancestral hometown and karmbhumi, to Dwarka, one of India\u2019s holiest cities on Ramnavami. After setting out on March 29, he covered about 20km daily, walking for about seven hours each night.\nIn Sanatan Dharm, the Sapta Puris \u2013 seven sacred cities \u2013 hold great significance. These are places where one can attain salvation and be freed from the cycle of birth and death. Among these Puris is Dwarka, the city of Krishn. This place is associated with salvation and symbolises duty, sacrifice, faith, and devotion. The padayatra, foot march, to Dwarka is as spiritually significant as the destination itself. Ambani\u2019s padayatra is particularly remarkable, as he undertook this strenuous journey while overcoming significant health related challenges.\n\nAlong the way, Ambani has encountered goodwill \u2013 some have walked along with him in solidarity, others have given him pictures of Dwarkadhish, and others have come over with their horses to take photos with him. In Sanatan Dharm, religious padayatras and pilgrimages are considered spiritual journeys that lead toward self-purification, devotion, and Self-realisation. These journeys serve as a means for the devotee to connect with the Divine. A padayatra helps focus one\u2019s thoughts, allowing the pilgrim to concentrate on more profound and meaningful questions of life. Yet, the mind is naturally restless; it tends to wander. Through mantras, stotras, and bhajans, it can be gently guided back to the right path. During the Dwarka padayatra too, if the mind begins to drift, it can be anchored by chanting Krishn\u2019s name: \u2018Hare Krishn hare Krishn, Krishn Krishn hare hare, hare Ram hare Ram, Ram Ram hare hare.\u2019\nA padayatra is filled with challenges. Difficulties lie in wait at every step, ready to test the pilgrim\u2019s resolve. In such moments, seeking refuge in Dwarkadhish offers protection and strength. For this, there is the powerful seed mantra of Dwarkadhish: AUM Kleem Krishnaya Namah.\nAnd when one seeks protection, it must be accompanied by complete surrender. One must let go of the self and fully trust Him, believing that if Krishn has willed it, it will surely be for the best.\nA padayatra is not merely about walking with the body \u2013 it is a journey of the mind. It begins when the mind sets aside worldly concerns and sets out to meet the Divine. When it forgets ego, anger, greed, and jealousy, and becomes absorbed in a single devotion, it is a form of tapasya, a quest to overcome hunger, thirst, and fatigue. It inspires one to look within and live a more disciplined, mindful life.\nAs one sets out on this path, there should be no burden of desires or attachments \u2013 only the spirit of surrender and a yearning to connect with Him. The journey to Dwarka is a journey to the Self. It is an opportunity to feel and become one with divine energy. Mantrasand bhajans support us along this path. That is why, at the Dwarkadhish Temple, one should chant: \u2018Jai Dwarkadhish, Jai Shri Krishn.\u2019\n\n",

Some people do, and some people don\u2019t \u2014 and that\u2019s totally okay!\nWhen you try to meditate (like sit quietly and focus on your breathing), you might notice your mind doesn\u2019t always want to stay still. It jumps around, showing pictures or videos in your head, or making you think in different languages if you know more than one. That voice in your head? That\u2019s called inner speech.\nBut here\u2019s the cool part: not everyone has that voice. Some people only \u201chear\u201d their thoughts when they actually say them out loud. Scientists gave this way of thinking a name: anendophasia. There\u2019s also something called aphantasia, where people don\u2019t see pictures in their head at all \u2014 like they don\u2019t have a mind movie.\nJust because someone doesn\u2019t think the same way you do doesn\u2019t mean something is wrong with them. It just means people\u2019s brains work in different ways. That\u2019s called diversity, and it makes the world more interesting!\nSome people even think they don\u2019t dream \u2014 but that might just mean they don\u2019t remember their dreams. There\u2019s still a lot we\u2019re learning about how our minds work.\nIn the movie Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, two people try to erase sad memories of each other. The doctor says it\u2019s like having a super forgetful night after staying up too late or maybe like after a big party. But even though they forget, they still feel like something\u2019s missing.\nSo whether your brain talks a mile a minute or just feels like quiet space, it\u2019s all part of what makes you you. Meditation might help calm things down, but no matter how your brain works \u2014 you\u2019re amazing just the way you are.\n\n",

        "full_article": "\n / EDITORIAL\n \n       April 08, 2025 00:00:00  \nTrue to their unholy alliance for market manipulation, the business syndicate of the staple has managed to maintain a soaring artificial price line for long. This is best exemplified by the fact that at a time when the average rice price in international market is 24.6 per cent lower than that of a year ago, the comparable domestic price of this main staple is 15-20 per cent higher. The FAO All Rice Price Index (FARPI) estimates that rice price fell by 1.7 per cent last month to an average of 104.1 points. While the price fall of rice in international market is lowest in three years, the domestic price defies the trend to record price increases unabatedly. With the medium, fine and aromatic varieties registering yet another hike ranging from Tk 2.0-4.0 and Tk 10-15 a kilogram for the first two varieties and the latter type respectively just before the Eid-ul-Fitr, there emerges the pattern of unethical tactics resorted to by millers and big rice traders for fleecing the consumers.\nTrading syndicates in Bangladesh target festivals, natural calamities that cause loss to crops and opportunities or even no opportunities at all to advance their aggressive profit mongering. The pre-Eid undesirable price hike was geared to cash in on the consumers' psychology of preference for finer rice varieties during the Ramadan and aromatic rice on the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr. Thus the business syndicates make undue profit to the tune of billions of taka each time they target a sought-after commodity/commodities on a particular occasion. This is a vicious ploy they have been resorting to with impunity. The business syndicate of rice knows it very well how to control the market and depending on the indispensability of the staple, they are taking both the people and the government for a ride. Strangely, no administration---military or civilian---has ever tried to take the bull by the horn. \nThe flash floods of last year's July-August that caused considerable damage to both standing paddy and cultivation of new crop have been used as a ploy by the syndicate to spike rice prices. Even the import of rice by both the government and private companies at prices much lower than the domestic price lines could not leave any positive impact on the volatile rice market. It is because private importers imported their quotas at their own pace not to glut the market and the government too has not shown enough promptness to import cereal to have its reflection on staple prices. It is more concerned about building a buffer stock rather than intervening in the market.\nMeanwhile, millers and stockists were smarter than the rice procurement teams to collect and build a stock of paddy and rice. They are now in a strong position to use the food as a weapon before which this soft-pedalling interim government is proving helpless. The July-August time of floods is also the time when student-led movement made miracle happen and put the interim government in charge. If the government's overwhelming concern is to bring about a whole range of reform to governance, it has failed to act innovatively and decisively to dismantle or streamline the bumbling bureaucracy and the business syndicates known as cohorts of the deposed regime and are the main sources of this country's social injustice and economic ills. It is time these two malfunctioning behemoths are strictly dealt with instead of pampering them.\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on August 5, 2023, marked the beginning of a downward spiral in bilateral ties. A series of diplomatic missteps, inflammatory rhetoric, and unresolved disputes further strained the bond between the two nations. \nAgainst this tense backdrop, the recent meeting between Bangladesh's Chief Adviser Dr. Muhammad Yunus and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the BIMSTEC Summit in Bangkok, has sparked cautious optimism. The fact that the dialogue took place -- despite uncertainty and resistance from hardliners on both sides -- suggests a mutual desire to mend fences. However, while the meeting may have thawed some of the ice, much more needs to be done to restore trust and ensure sustainable cooperation. \nThe deterioration in Indo-Bangla relations can be traced to several factors: \nThe abrupt removal of Sheikh Hasina's government last year created a leadership vacuum, leading to policy paralysis in Dhaka. India, which had enjoyed a close partnership with Hasina's administration, found itself navigating unfamiliar terrain with the new caretaker setup. \nExtremist factions in both countries seized the opportunity to fuel tensions. A section of the Indian media launched a relentless campaign portraying Bangladesh as a hotbed of communalism and extremism, further poisoning public sentiment. Similarly, anti-India rhetoric in Bangladesh gained traction, with critics accusing New Delhi of interfering in domestic politics. \nKey connectivity projects, including rail and road links, were scaled back disrupting trade and people-to-people exchanges. The suspension of previously agreed-upon initiatives deepened mistrust. \nTwo contentious issues continue to loom large: first one is the extradition of Sheikh Hasina, against whom Bangladesh court issued warrant for crimes against humanity, and the second is the alleged attacks on minorities in Bangladesh, which has been weaponised by hardliners in India to stoke tensions. \nThe Yunus-Modi meeting was significant for several reasons. Powerful factions in both the countries have been seeking to derail the dialogue. Hate campaigns and malicious propaganda overshadowed the summit, but the fact that the way the talks proceeded was indicative of a mature diplomatic approach from both sides. \nReports suggest that the discussions covered trade, connectivity, security, and minority rights. However, the lack of a detailed joint statement has led to speculations. Transparency is crucial -- any ambiguity risks fueling further distrust. \nBy engaging directly, both leaders signalled that dialogue, not confrontation, is the way forward. This is a welcome shift from the zero-sum mindset that has dominated the recent discourse. \nProf Yunus and Mr Modi concluded their 'fruitful and honest dialogue by wishing each other good health and personal well-being' and extended their best wishes for continued peace, progress, and prosperity for the peoples of both countries.\nThe meeting discussed India's concern over the condition of minorities in Bangladesh. In response, Chief Adviser said, the reports of attacks on the minorities were hugely inflated and \"the bulk of them were fake news\". He asked the Indian leader to send Indian newsmen to Bangladesh to investigate the alleged attacks themselves.\nIn the meeting Bangladesh Chief Adviser also told the Indian Prime Minister that his government had instituted an effective system to monitor every incident of religious and gender violence in the country, and his government was taking serious actions to stop occurrence of such incidents.\nIt is widely believed that such open and frank discussions will help to remove misunderstanding between the two sides and more dialogues will follow the Bangkok meeting.\nThe leaders of these two major South Asian countries greeted each other with mutual respect and a shared openness for dialogue. Their 40-minute exchange was 'candid, productive, and constructive'.\nThe tones of the two leaders are worth reviewing. \"Bangladesh deeply values its relationship with India, The deep-rooted friendship between our two countries is founded on intertwined histories, geographical proximity, and cultural affinity. We remain thankful for the unwavering support of the government and people of India during our most challenging time in 1971\", said Dr Yunus.\nIn response, the Indian Prime Minister said New Delhi has always attached highest priority to its relationship with Dhaka. \"The history of the two neighbours is intricately linked, and it goes back to the birth of Bangladesh\", he said.\nSo there is no doubt that the Bangkok meeting was a positive step, but sustained efforts are needed to repair the strained relationship.\nMeanwhile, there is an urgent need to settle the water sharing issue of the 54 rivers that run across the two countries.\nIndia's failure to ink a deal on the water sharing of the Teesta River caused huge resentment among people in Bangladesh.\nIn fact the ties between the two countries started souring over water sharing issue when India had commissioned the Farrakhan Barrage on the Ganges River to divert its water. \nThe signing of the Ganges water sharing deal was a positive step to allay the concern of Bangladesh.\nHowever, since the treaty is going to expire next year it is expected that India will show sincerity to renew the deal.\nPolicy-level figures in both nations must refrain from making derogatory remarks. Media outlets should also be discouraged from sensationalising bilateral tensions. \nMany feel that reviving pre-August 2024 transport and trade links should be revived as well as the pending projects like and power grid connectivity expedited. \nIndia must resolve the Hasina extradition issue in line with the aspirations of the majority people of Bangladesh.\nSimilarly Bangladesh must address concerns over minority safety, while India should avoid exploiting the issue for domestic politics. \nAfter August 2024, India imposed a curb on normal visa issuance process for Bangladeshi citizens which is viewed in Bangladesh as a retaliatory step. Restoring the normalisation of this process is crucial to restore trust.\nAt the same time, India must remove the perception that it 'takes more than it gives. A win-win framework -- where Bangladesh gains tangible benefits from cooperation -- is essential. \nProgressive voices in both countries must counter hardline narratives and promote people-to-people ties. \nAs the old adage goes, 'You can change your friends, but not your neighbours', neither India nor Bangladesh can afford prolonged hostility. The historical, cultural, and economic bonds between the two nations are too deep to be severed by short-term political turbulence. \nThe Yunus-Modi meeting has opened a window for reconciliation. Now, both governments must act openly and sincerely, and demonstrate mutual respect to ensure that this opportunity is not squandered. The people of both countries deserve peace, prosperity, and partnership -- not perpetual tension.\nmirmostafiz@yahoo.com\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Increase in frequency, intensity and duration of the heatwaves is now the new normal. Of course, ultimately, climate change is to blame for this situation. But can we really wash our hands of the fact that Dhaka is getting hotter by the day? According to an estimate, Dhaka's average temperature has increased by 3 degrees celsius in the last 20 years. That means just a decade ago it was less hot or cooler by1.5 to 2 degrees celsius. No wonder, rapid but unplanned urbanisation is the main culprit that is behind Dhaka's becoming a veritable concrete jungle that captures more heat than it can radiate. This is a phenomenon that the British climatologist Gordon Marley first observed in 1958 and termed it 'Urban Heat Island (UHI)'. However, by whatever name you might call it, the experience of it cannot be said to be pleasant. Dhaka could be far cooler if the government itself, the previous autocratic government, to be specific, did not mercilessly felled trees in the name of development work. \nConsider the case of the Suhrawardy Udyan, which was once called the 'lungs of Dhaka'. But that 'lungs' had to be forcefully removed to build what the then Liberation War Affairs ministry called 'Suhrawardy Udyane Swadhinata Stomvo Nirman (Independence Pillar Construction at Suhrawardy Udyan'). And to implement that grandiose scheme, hundreds of trees were cut down as if with a vengeance. It was indeed an act of vengeance. That is because the Suhrawardy Udyan was created by someone who to the then autocratic political establishment was its number one adversary. So, despite Suhrawardy Udyan's immense value from the point of view of its being a site of rich environmental heritage, the then government went ahead with decimating it. A group of environmental activists, among whom was also our present interim government's Adviser for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, tried their best to save the Suhrawardy Udyan by filing writ petition in the High Court. But their efforts ultimately fizzled out. Like the Udyan's children park was abandoned for reasons not hard to understand, the present Suhrawardy Udyan is also a mere shadow of its former self now with a few trees standing here and there and the empty space created by clearing it of trees is now occupied by vendors, conjurors, sellers of street foods and teashops. Had Suhrawardy Udyan been not thus destroyed, it could contribute towards making the city cooler and providing sanctuary to dozens of bird species and small animals. The interim government can and should now take up a project to restore the Suhrawardy Udyan and engage experts including its adviser for environment, Syeda Rizwana Hasan, who is herself a well known environment crusader, to redevelop the Udyan and bring back its former shape as far as possible.\nSmall businesses operating there can be relocated elsewhere in the city to protect their livelihood. But the effort of the government should not end with taking steps to just revive and protect the Suhrawardy Udyan. Steps should also be there to find out more such spots in the city which were once small gardens, fields or parks, but now in disuse and convert those into small Udyans. The now lost wetlands, both within and surrounding the city, which were vital components of the city's natural ecosystem may not be revived. Even so, it is important to protect whatever is still left of them. Long story short, Dhaka needs more trees to protect itself against its rising temperature as well as the increasing number of heatwaves.\nsfalim.ds@gmail.com\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The way the economy is heading, it seems likely that in 10-15 years, there may not be a single retail investor left in the market. With widespread rumors and misinformation surrounding the stock market, how can this industry survive? Many young professionals hesitate to invest due to a lack of knowledge and practical experience, leading to missed opportunities, poor financial decisions, and economic setbacks.\nThe current economic situation in Bangladesh reflects the growing need for financial literacy. With inflationary pressures, rising unemployment, and global economic uncertainties, the need for sound financial decisions has never been more critical. The stock market could play a pivotal role in economic growth, but without an informed investing population, these opportunities are underutilised. The lack of financial education leads to caution, fear, and unwillingness to invest, leaving the economy at risk of stunted growth and reduced capital inflow.\nSimvest is bridging this gap by providing a hands-on learning platform where students can learn, practice, and trade stocks using real-time market data. Unlike traditional financial education, which often lacks practical application, Simvest enables users to gain experience before entering real markets. By partnering with brokerage firms and educational institutions, Simvest is equipping the next generation with the skills needed for informed investing.\nWith initiatives like Simvest, future generations will grow up with financial literacy from an early stage, developing financial independence in stock market knowledge. This will lead to an influx of investments in Bangladesh's economy, driving growth and strengthening the overall financial landscape. A financially aware generation means more strategic investments, stronger businesses, and a more resilient national economy.\nThe solution to this growing concern lies in empowering the youth through education. By enabling students to practice and understand the stock market early on, Simvest is fostering a generation of informed investors who will actively participate in the market, contributing to a robust economy. This approach will lead to a ripple effect, encouraging more investments, improving market liquidity, and ultimately boosting the nation's economic resilience.\nWithout proper financial education, young investors will continue to struggle, limiting economic growth. Encouraging hands-on learning through fintech solutions like Simvest will empower students with the confidence and knowledge to navigate the stock market successfully. I urge policymakers and educators to support financial literacy initiatives that prepare young professionals for long-term financial success.\nMuntaha Tafannum Farazi\nBachelor of Business Administration (BBA)\nNorth South University \nfarazimuntaha@gmail.com\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
