The debates reflected the significant divergence of opinion on the management of Waqf properties, but were held in a convivial atmosphere. The Chairs of both Houses were elated to preside over a productive session and the ruling BJP was content to find allies strongly on its side, particularly on the Waqf law amendment. Parliament also approved President\u2019s Rule in Manipur, following debates held past midnight. The Opposition was buoyant that it got to have its say. It had its constituents holding together, and it even attracted some fence-sitters on select issues during the session. The BJP not only managed to steer the legislative agenda but also played to the gallery to please its political constituency. It was, however, not all good news. Off the floor of Parliament, business advisory committee meetings of the two Houses saw sharp exchanges, in one instance prompting Rajya Sabha Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar to walk out. The stand-off between the Congress and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, on the Lok Sabha Leader of the Opposition, Rahul Gandhi, not being given adequate opportunities to speak, remained unresolved.The vote on the Waqf Bill exposed the differences within the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) as well as the divergence between prospective allies, the BJP and the AIADMK. The BJD\u2019s decision not to issue a whip riled many within the party, more so considering BJD patriarch Naveen Patnaik\u2019s clear stance against the Waqf Bill. One of the reasons for the AIADMK-BJP split in 2023, was the regional party\u2019s fear of losing its minority voter base. The AIADMK voted against the Waqf Bill, underscoring its reservations about the BJP\u2019s agenda. While the YSRCP, the AIADMK and the BJD showed an eagerness to keep a distance from the BJP, the JD(U) and the TDP ended up in an embrace of their dominant ally. The merits of the Waqf amendments may be debatable but the government\u2019s refusal to take the Muslim community into confidence on an important piece of legislation is a classic sign of majoritarianism. Barring a nominated member in the upper House, no Muslim MP supported the amendments. The Waqf debate also highlighted the fact that the ruling alliance does not have a single elected member from the community in Parliament. Beyond the veneer of efficient outcomes, the session sharpened political and communal polarisation. Discussions should ideally expand the common ground, but this session failed on that count.

        "full_article": "While ordering the Wikimedia Foundation to undo changes on the Wikipedia page on Asian News International (ANI), the Delhi High Court said \u201cpeople at large have a tendency to accept statements made on [Wikipedia\u2019s] web pages \u2026 as gospel truth\u201d. In the hearing of the defamation suit that ANI had filed in 2024, the court had taken some questionable positions. For example, it sought the identities of the volunteers who edited the ANI page, whose anonymity the platform allows to protect them from retaliation. When the Foundation sought more time, the court observed: \u201cWe will close your business transactions here... We will ask the government to block Wikipedia\u2026 If you don\u2019t like India, please don\u2019t work in India.\u201d The Foundation had appealed for its right to safe harbour under the Information Technology Act 2000, but the court concluded in favour of the plaintiff because, it observed, \u201cstatements on the page pertaining to the plaintiff are all sourced from \u2026 editorials and opinionated pages\u201d. Wikipedia is written and maintained by volunteers who are expected to follow the platform\u2019s guidelines. Unlike newspapers or scientific journals, the encyclopedia does not purport to publish new information; volunteers are instead expected to repeat with attribution or reproduce with references, information originally published elsewhere, with a preference for reputable sources. In this light, the court order is problematic.Elements of truth today are often mistaken to be someone\u2019s opinions and vice versa. Politicians and government agencies have been known to punish civil society for repeating an allegedly offensive claim rather than address the original claim itself. Opinions are rejected even as data is withheld to deny those who express them opportunities to align them with verifiable facts. In this case, the court had expressed concern for ANI\u2019s credibility, whether volunteers who edited the ANI page had followed the platform\u2019s guidelines in letter and spirit, and whether the opinion as expressed on the page could be allowed to stand. In the process, it established that the Foundation\u2019s ability to maintain the democratic structure that has allowed Wikipedia to become so popular and reliable is limited for India\u2019s users: to the extent of public tolerance for certain opinions. Ultimately, the aforementioned \u201cpeople\u2019s tendency\u201d and the state\u2019s ability to influence it put Wikipedia and similar decentralised collaborations at risk. That is a tragedy. These collaborations adopted their designs to sidestep the sort of centralised information control that some countries, including India, have sought. Courts and the state would do well to accommodate these collaborative efforts rather than treat them with contempt \u2014 and the people should engage with these efforts and their guidelines as well.\r Published - April 07, 2025 12:10 am IST\n                          Read  Comments \n                Copy link  \n                        \n            \n                    Email     \n                                \n                \n                Facebook   \n                        \n            \n                Twitter    \n                        \n            \n                Telegram     \n                        \n            \n                LinkedIn     \n                        \n            \n                WhatsApp\n                \n                        \n            \n                Reddit      \n                        \n            READ LATER\n                    Remove     \n                \n                SEE ALL         \n                PRINT\n            Related Topics\n        \n                        judiciary (system of justice)\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        media\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        online\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        laws\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        politics\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        government\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        democracy\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        India\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        journals and diaries",

        "full_article": "Will India or Vietnam make the best of an iconic American company\u2019s supply chain woes?\nBloodbath. For US stock after stock, that was the commonest fate on Liberation Day. Apple, the world\u2019s most valuable company, saw its shares slide 16% over Thursday and Friday. The April 2 tariffs have it in a pincer grip. China, which still assembles about 80% of the about 220mn iPhones sold in a year, has been hit with a 54% tariff. Analysts say this could mean a whopping 40% rise in iPhone prices. They are still lifting their jaws off the ground after watching Trump knocking out American icons like this. Apple has to deal with this blow in a flattening smartphone market. In its woes is the story of all businesses scrambling to rejig their global supply chain in the stormy new tariffverse.\nAs TOI reported yesterday, the company has already made \u201cunusually high\u201d number of shipments to US, from factories in India and China. So it may be able to hold off a retail price hike for a bit. India, which assembles around 15% of iPhones, has been hit with a 26% tariff. This is lower than China\u2019s but way more than companies planned for when they started diversifying here, impelled by Trump\u2019s first term and then by Covid. India, however, saw limited benefits from this China Plus strategy compared to countries like Vietnam. Factors ranging from simplifying tax laws to proactively signing FTAs helped the others pull ahead of us in expanding their export shares. This time around, the stakes are even higher. China\u2019s now thrown retaliatory tariffs into the ring. \u201cThey panicked \u2013 the one thing they cannot afford to do,\u201d Trump said. But our columnist today suggests that Washington will not be engaging in tariff negotiations with China anyway.\n\nBetween them things are bound to get worse. Other countries hope to get a happier hearing. Vietnam, hit with a 49% tariff, has talked to Trump already, offering to pull down its own tariff wall altogether in exchange for US softening. Vietnam has a $123.46bn trade surplus with US, compared to India\u2019s $45.66bn. They will both do what it takes to benefit from the strategic decoupling of US from China. If the April 2 tariffs stay sticky, it should be advantage India. But the ifs are infinite. One thing that\u2019s certain is that any smartphone manufacturing that moves to US is less likely to be done by Americans \u2013 than by their robots.\n\n",

Its family had lived harmoniously for countless generations, \u2018Owner\u2019s Pride. Neighbour\u2019s Envy\u2019. But this exemplary brotherhood was coming increasingly unstuck. Instead of \u2018We are the world\u2019 it was more \u2018Things fall apart, the centre cannot hold\u2019. In fact, centre often didn\u2019t want to.\nThus encouraged, Biggest Brother to start bossing over smaller siblings. Yes-ji,\u00a0 \u00a0traditionally, even legally, he had greater rights to property and decision-making. But so far he\u2019d been congenial, and not merely for the sake of familial unity. He was actually a big hearted guy, more like all-embracing philosophy than rigid religion. But to quote Yeats again, \u2018All this has changed, changed utterly.\u2019\u00a0\nFirst, Biggest Bro put his foot down when a sibling wanted to marry a man of her own choice. Only because he\u2019d quite baselessly decided that not any pyar-vyar, but impurely ulterior motives had ensnared naive behna. His cohorts ganged up and hounded the hapless couple to death.\u00a0\nThen he dictated what everyone should eat. Or not eat. Since the larger family had diverse likes, this deprived some members of their regular food, and occasionally even livelihood.\u00a0\nEat, love, so of course pray was pushed on the ban-wagon. One Mumbai Christmas, \u2018midnight mass\u2019 lost its raison d\u2019\u00eatre by being shifted to 9pm. Another brother has been most affected. This March 14, his holy month coincided with Biggest Bhaiya\u2019s boisterous festival. So in UP and elsewhere,\u00a0 Smaller played safe and postponed jumma prayers till Bigger finished playing Holi.\u00a0\u00a0\nLast week saw two onslaughts. An uncharitable bill on most-put-upon brother\u2019s charities. And, double festive-spoiler whammy. Eid namaz was forced out of its public spaces, and meat out of biryani in Biggest Bro states. Since his \u2018pure veg\u2019 festival had begun, \u2018No slaughter within 500 metres of place of worship\u2019. This amounted to blanket ban since every corner now boasts a shrine.\u00a0\nAs it must, no?
