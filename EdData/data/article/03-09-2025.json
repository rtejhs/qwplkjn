It has been seven years since Mr. Modi had travelled to China, and his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping was their first such bilateral engagement since the military standoff of 2020. It has been three years since Mr. Modi attended the SCO summit, a Eurasian grouping seen as decidedly anti-western. Meanwhile, photographs of the bonhomie between Mr. Modi, Mr. Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin evoked memories of an inactive Russia-India-China (RIC) trilateral. The bilateral meeting with China saw the two leaders give their approval to the normalisation process initiated in October 2024, leading from troop disengagement along the LAC. The two sides agreed to fast-track the boundary resolution process being discussed by their Special Representatives. They also gave the green light for the resumption of direct flights, visa facilitation, and the building of economic ties to \u201cstabilize world trade\u201d. As Mr. Modi committed to \u201ctaking forward ties ...based on mutual trust, respect and sensitivity\u201d, Mr. Xi called for the \u201cDragon (China) and the Elephant (India) to come together\u201d. Such bonhomie was unthinkable even a year ago, and it is clear that it has been driven, in some measure, by the U.S. moves to impose tariffs and sanctions on India, and New Delhi\u2019s sense of mistrust about the Trump administration\u2019s intentions. This allowed Mr. Modi and his delegation, for the moment, to side-step some of the concerns India has had over China\u2019s actions, including its support to Pakistan during Operation Sindoor, the blocking of Indian moves on UNSC reforms and NSG membership, and holds on designating Pakistan-based terrorists.It was significant that the Tianjin declaration included strong language against the \u201ccross-border movement of terrorists\u201d, albeit condemning the Pahalgam attack and attacks in Balochistan against Pakistani forces, in equal measure. The declaration also saw the entire SCO membership find common ground on contentious issues such as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and condemnation of U.S.-Israeli strikes on Iran, although India maintained its opposition to the paragraph supporting China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative. Mr. Xi\u2019s plans for an SCO Development Bank, and Mr. Modi\u2019s suggestion of initiating a \u201cCivilisational Dialogue\u201d between SCO members found mention. While the outcomes and the optics made for what Mr. Modi described as a \u201cproductive\u201d visit to China, his itinerary missed some opportunities for closer engagement with leaders from India\u2019s neighbourhood and the Global South, as he skipped the \u201cSCO Plus\u201d Summit.READ MORE Published - September 03, 2025 12:20 am IST\n                          Read  Comments \n                Copy link  \n                        \n            \n                    Email     \n                                \n                \n                Facebook   \n                        \n            \n                Twitter    \n                        \n            \n                Telegram     \n                        \n            \n                LinkedIn     \n                        \n            \n                WhatsApp\n                \n                        \n            \n                Reddit      \n                        \n            READ LATER\n                    Remove     \n                \n                SEE ALL         \n                PRINT\n            Related Topics\n        \n                        Prime Minister Narendra Modi\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        diplomacy\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        China\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        government\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Russia\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        South Africa\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        armed conflict\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        armed Forces\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        defence\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        air transport\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        trade policy\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Pakistan\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Operation Sindoor 2025\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        United Nations\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        terrorism (crime)\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Pahalgam terror attack 2025\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Israel-Palestine Conflict\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Belt and Road Initiative\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        banking\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Myanmar\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Nepal\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Maldives",

        "full_article": "Afghanistan reeled on Monday (September 1, 2025) in the wake of a strong earthquake and multiple after-shocks, killing over 1,400 people, and injuring at least 3,100. According to the United States Geological Survey, the primary tremor was an earthquake of magnitude 6.3 and had struck near Jalalabad, Nangarhar province. After the first tremor, of magnitude 6.3, at a depth of eight kilometres, another earthquake, of magnitude 4.7, struck around 140 km from the epicentre of the initial tremor. The impact of the disaster is playing out in the Kunar and Nangarhar provinces where rescue efforts are on to find and extricate survivors and locate bodies that are buried under piles of rubble. What makes the salvage operations particularly challenging are the limited resources available to authorities given that the ruling Taliban regime faces multiple sanctions. This has been particularly stark following the withdrawal of the United States from Afghanistan in 2021. The United Nations and international humanitarian agencies have voiced their condolences and expressed support to aid the wounded and assist with relief operations.Afghanistan, which abuts the Hindu Kush mountains, and is at the junction of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates, lives under the constant threat of an earthquake. Since 1900, there have reportedly been 12 earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 7 in north-east Afghanistan. In October 2023, the western Herat province was devastated by an earthquake of magnitude 6.3, and several aftershocks, which killed more than 1,500 people and damaged or destroyed more than 63,000 homes. Given the vulnerability of the region, it also bears out that earthquakes of this magnitude and epicentre-depth cause much less damage to lives and property in several parts of the world. Delhi, in February 2025, reported a quake of magnitude 4, at a relatively shallow \u2014 and, therefore, potentially more devastating \u2014 depth of five kilometres below the surface. True, a quake of magnitude 6 is roughly 100 times more powerful than a one of magnitude 4 assuming similar depths of origin, but there was no physical damage at all reported anywhere in Delhi. At the other end, Chile is regularly besieged by quakes greater than a magnitude of 6, with all accounts suggesting minimal infrastructural damage and no attributable casualties. This is due to the country\u2019s focused commitment to enforcing building codes. Earthquakes need not be a death sentence and Afghanistan must take decisive steps to strengthen its building codes and work to spread awareness on their enforcement.READ MORE Published - September 03, 2025 12:10 am IST\n                          Read  Comments \n                Copy link  \n                        \n            \n                    Email     \n                                \n                \n                Facebook   \n                        \n            \n                Twitter    \n                        \n            \n                Telegram     \n                        \n            \n                LinkedIn     \n                        \n            \n                WhatsApp\n                \n                        \n            \n                Reddit      \n                        \n            READ LATER\n                    Remove     \n                \n                SEE ALL         \n                PRINT\n            Related Topics\n        \n                        Afghanistan\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        earthquake\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        USA\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        natural disasters\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        disaster management\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        economic sanction\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        United Nations\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        mountains\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Chile\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        Delhi\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        India\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        geology",

        "full_article": "MUMBAI\nIf Jarange has \u2018won\u2019, his actions, like farmer protests in Delhi, set this template: got a demand, shut down a city\nYesterday, Maharashtra govt finally negotiated terms for a Jarange climbdown. This is a relief for Mumbai. But how low Mumbai was brought and how fast, remains a worry. Indeed, the city\u2019s acute suffering only got actioned after the judiciary stepped into what should have been an obvious job for the executive. To recap, after Jarange and his fellow protesters fractured life and business in large parts of Mumbai beginning Friday, govt response was mostly to just clean up after them. Only thanks to Bombay high court\u2019s intervention on Monday did authorities begin to restore order around the designated protest area, Azad Maidan.\nIt revisited the matter in even more forceful terms on Tuesday. It observed, \u201cYou cannot force an HC judge to walk like this just because your protesters were dancing on the road.\u201d The point is that this was a mass plaint \u2013 patients being forced to miss hospital appointments, students missing classes, gig workers missing their daily livelihood, BSE and the nation\u2019s other prime establishments compelled to shelter behind increased security. Insofar as this is fundamentally a matter of civil liberties, the scale on which these have been splintered in the Maximum City sends an ominous message to the entire country.\nAround Delhi, farmer protests have played out in a similar way. Last Dsecember, SC said in the context of agitating farmers yet again obstructing highways, \u201cIn a democratic setup, you can engage in peaceful protests but do not cause inconvenience to people.\u201d Think about how many groups have genuine or imagined grievances in our raucous democracy. The Maratha and farmer protests are partly rooted in economic dysfunction, where there simply hasn\u2019t been enough job creation to transition Indians out of agriculture as they want. If Trump\u2019s tariffs and temper don\u2019t wane, more challenging times lie ahead. If ever India had room to idle any of its economic engines, of which cities are a prime example, it\u2019s not right now.\nOur cities occupy just 3% of the land and contribute a massive 60% of GDP. Our metropolises are particularly good at introducing opportunities to migrants as much as to locals. But to continue this, a basic social contract has to be respected by all stakeholders. Most importantly, govt cannot allow one protesting group privileges denied to most. Because that creates a template for anarchy. What one set of protesters have wrought on Mumbai this week, another, and yet another may now emulate, in Mumbai or another city.\n\u00a0\nGURGAON\nA city many thought would symbolise India\u2019s shining future is now an advertisement for India\u2019s worst failings\nA rainy day could very well be a Gurgaon resident\u2019s worst nightmare. Barely had Delhi\u2019s satellite town lamented the breakdown of its municipality\u2019s garbage collection system than waterlogging brought the city to near-collapse \u2013 an annual recurrence in monsoon. So, in a town where \u20b9100 cr apartments are not uncommon, every monsoon, there\u2019ll be videos of traffic at a standstill over long stretches, of cars half-submerged, and stories of commuters spending 5 hours on the road for a few kms ride.\nGurgaon was supposed to be liberalised India\u2019s dream town. BPO and IT/ ITES hub, Fortune 500 HQs, developers\u2019 playfield, toniest apartments, glitziest malls, country\u2019s third richest by per capita income \u2013 Gurgaon rose and rose in so many ways and reached for the sky, tall and glorious. Till it didn\u2019t. Because, oops, someone forgot the plumbing. Someone looked away when developers took over. Was there even a drainage plan for the new city that was coming up? Apparently not. Govt barely had infra in place for the old village avtar of Gurgaon. And private developers weren\u2019t about to lay drainage networks. Someone built roads over existing drains. Someone let old Gurgaon\u2019s lakes and ponds be cemented. Pipes laid in later years had sections missing. Someone turned a blind eye as residences and offices encroached over commons.

Adding to Gurgaon\u2019s woes is the near-total absence of public transport \u2013 a crippling deficiency given the ever-expanding residential areas and commercial spaces stretching to Manesar.

That city is Gurgaon, right next to Delhi. But today, it\u2019s also a symbol of how badly things can go wrong when planning is ignored.\nEvery monsoon, Gurgaon turns into a mess. Heavy rain means flooded roads, cars stuck in water, and people spending 5 hours just to travel a few kilometres. Videos of half-submerged cars and endless traffic jams pop up every year. This happens even though some people here live in homes worth hundreds of crores!\nWhy does this keep happening? Because when the city was being built, nobody planned properly for drains and water flow. Old ponds and lakes were filled with cement, drains were covered by roads, and pipes were laid badly with gaps. So, when it rains, there\u2019s nowhere for the water to go. Garbage, plastic, and clogged drains make it worse.\nPublic transport is also almost missing. The metro covers only a small part of the city, so most people have to use cars or bikes for even short trips. This makes traffic jams worse and adds to pollution.\nGurgaon was meant to be a dream city, with IT companies, multinational offices, and the richest lifestyles. Instead, it\u2019s become an example of what happens when cities grow without proper planning. And sadly, unless things change, the same problems will repeat next year too.\n\n",

And it\u2019s been escalated to the Supreme Court no less, not once but twice.\nThe hostilities are provoked by India\u2019s so-called stray dogs. In that descriptive tag is where the problem lies.\nThe dogs that inhabit the streets of India are not strays who\u2019ve strayed in from elsewhere. That term better suits the foreign breeds, like German Shepherds and Labradors, brought into this country by breeders who mate them incestuously for customers who deem exotic and expensive canines to be a status symbol, and think a Great Dane is Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet.\nThe native Indian street dog is healthier, hardier, more faithful, and friendlier, making for a much better companion than any imported and inbred counterpart.\nRound them all up and get rid of them any which way you can, says the anti-dog brigade.That\u2019s barbaric, contend animal welfare advocates. SC\u2019s first order suggested shelters. Some critics asked: Shelters? For dogs? When we can\u2019t provide shelters for people who sleep on pavements? The second order, thankfully, restored the status quo ante.\nBut disputes continue. One argument is that those most vulnerable to canine attacks are daily-wagers and slum-dwellers who must leave their children unattended. The well-off, goes this argument, are safe in gated communities, and can afford the luxury of being kind to strays.\nThe other argument is that street dogs grow in numbers and become a menace when well-meaning but misguided people feed them outdoors, and unwittingly establish food territoriality, which must aggressively be protected against perceived intruders, four legged or two.\u00a0The counter that SC heard is that strays going unfed is a bigger public safety issue. So, SC has designated feeding zones.\nPerhaps, those who feed street dogs on the roadside should extend their magnanimity to accommodate the maxim: Don\u2019t give the dog a bone, unless you can also give it a home.\n\n",

It was only when the Bombay High Court (a very important court) stepped in that order was restored. The judges even said, \u201cYou cannot make a judge walk like this just because protestors are dancing on the road!\u201d That showed how badly the city was disrupted.\nThis isn\u2019t new.

But certain provisions of the Bangladesh Bank Order (BBO) 1972, under which the BB operates, constrain its power to do whatever is necessary to achieve its objectives. Those include, for instance, the establishment of discipline in the financial sector, taking measures to curb inflation and stabilising consumer price, to adopt monetary policies, managing foreign exchange reserves, advising the government on economic policy and so on. \nSo, effecting the long-awaited amendment to the BBO is a pressing issue. The draft ordinance to this effect prepared by the interim government last month (August 2025) on the process of appointing the BB governor vested with necessary autonomy, among other reforms, was supposed to be deliberated upon at a recently held meeting of the BB's governing board. But as reported in the September 1 issue of this paper, the responsible central bank officials could not place the draft on BBO reform for discussion at the BB's last governing board meeting. The reason was, as reported referring to some BB officials concerned, \"non-cooperation of the government secretaries\" on the BB's 9-member governing board. This was unfortunate, particularly at a time when the interim government is in a race against time to complete as many of the vital reform agenda it has undertaken before holding the next general election. In this context, the urgency of reforming the BBO cannot be gainsaid. So, any delay in the process of amending the BBO has the potential to stymie the very effort towards granting the BB governor the sought-after autonomy. For, once finalised at the BB board meeting, the draft could be forwarded to the government for its early approval before passing as the BBO amendment ordinance. \nBut to all appearances, the process has been stalled for the time being. So, one wonders, what was here the exact nature of the proverbial slip between the cup and the lip that led the BB's governing board to defer the necessary deliberations indefinitely as its next meeting date is yet to be fixed. \nTrue, the bureaucracy has the notoriety of often sweeping many burning issues under the carpet. But in this particular case of BBO amendment, no excuse is acceptable given the central bank's past legacy of becoming a mere tool in the hands of civil service, and, by default, the politics in power, to serve vested interests. \nAllegedly, some members of the BB's governing board who happens to be government secretaries rejected the suggestion that the proposed draft of the amended BB order was not put up for discussion at the said governing body meeting of the BB. On the contrary, they reportedly pointed to some observations they claimed to have made about the draft that needed correction before being placed at the next governing board meeting. While giving due considerations to their point, the fact remains that the exercise of finding the lacunae in the draft and correcting those could well be done more expeditiously without unnecessarily delaying the process because time is so precious in the present context. To be frank, it is time the central bank gets the autonomy to function without unnecessary government control once it is established as a constitutional entity. In that case, it is imperative that the bottlenecks, if any, in the process of finalising the draft of the amended BB Ordinance are removed sooner rather than later.\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "full_article": "\n / EDITORIAL\n   Wasi Ahmed   |  \n       September 03, 2025 00:00:00  \n\nThe fact that Bangladesh currently produces nearly 12 million tonnes of potatoes -- around 4.0 million tonnes in surplus -- is no mean achievement. It signals the country's rising agricultural capacity and the farmers' resilience. Yet, the paradox lies in the shocking reality that this surplus, instead of generating substantial export earnings, often goes to waste. Farmers, who should have been celebrating bumper harvests, end up facing distress sales due to inadequate storage facilities, poor marketing strategies and the absence of a well-devised export policy.\nFor several years now, abundant potato harvest has ironically become a source of misery for growers. The absence of adequate planning -- particularly the lack of sufficient cold storages near potato-growing belts -- forces farmers to offload their produce at throwaway prices. In a severely underpriced domestic market, where demand is limited, the burden of bumper harvests falls squarely on growers who often struggle to recover even their production costs.\nAccording to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), potato production reached an all-time high of 11.57 million tonnes in the fiscal year 2024-25. This marked a 9.17 per cent increase over the previous year's 10.60 million tonnes. The increase was driven largely by the expansion of acreage -- around 35,000 hectares more than the previous year -- and favourable weather conditions. Ironically, while production soared, farm-gate prices slumped to their lowest in a decade.\nThe mismatch between production and consumption is at the heart of this crisis. Estimates by the Tuber Research Centre (TRC) and the Bangladesh Cold Storage Association (BCSA) suggest that domestic demand for potatoes stands at just over 9.0 million tonnes annually, including 1.0 million tonnes set aside for seeds. Of this, around 8.0 million tonnes are directly consumed as food, with a portion used in food processing industries for chips, crackers, and other products. Exports, however, remain negligible-barely crossing 62,000 tonnes in FY25. Compared to the total output, this is an insignificant volume, doing little to absorb the mounting surplus.\nTo ease the glut in the domestic market, the BCSA has suggested that the government include 10 kilograms of potatoes per household in its social safety net schemes. Such an initiative, they argue, could absorb at least 1.0 million tonnes from cold storages, benefiting both farmers and low-income consumers. However, while such domestic adjustments may offer temporary relief, the real and sustainable solution lies in boosting exports.\nThe question, therefore, is why potato exports have not yet gained traction. The global demand for potatoes is undeniable. Eastern European countries, including Russia and other former Soviet states, remain major consumers and are heavily dependent on imports despite Russia being the world's third-largest producer after China and India. Bangladesh, the seventh-largest potato producer, is well-positioned to cater to these markets. Yet exports remain constrained by several obstacles.\nA major setback came when Russia imposed a temporary ban on Bangladeshi potatoes after detecting fungal diseases. The ban highlighted a structural weakness -- the absence of accredited laboratories in Bangladesh for pre-shipment testing and certification in line with international standards, particularly those of Russia and the European Union. Without such testing facilities, it is impossible to build a credible export pipeline to high-demand markets. Although Bangladesh has been exporting to some East European countries since 2011, a lack of systematic quality control has stunted growth.\nExperts believe that if Bangladesh can align its production practices with market-specific preferences and meet sanitary and phyto-sanitary requirements, potato exports could rise significantly. This would not only open up new revenue streams for the country but also improve farm-gate prices, offering farmers a fair return on their investment and hard work. Increased exports would also reduce wastage, as the current surplus often rots in cold storages or remains unsold.\nMaking this vision a reality requires a comprehensive policy and investment package. Accredited testing laboratories must be established urgently to meet international quality standards. Cold storage facilities need to be expanded and modernised, especially in high-production regions. Export logistics -- ranging from transportation and packaging to customs clearance -- must be streamlined. Equally important, farmers need access to training and guidance on producing export-grade potatoes that meet the specifications of importing countries.\nExport promotion cannot be viewed as a mere side business; it has to be pursued as a national priority, given its potential multiplier effects. Beyond immediate relief for farmers, successful potato exports could generate foreign exchange, create jobs across the supply chain and contribute to rural development.\nIn the final analysis, the challenge is less about producing potatoes -- since Bangladesh has already proven its capacity to achieve record harvests -- and more about managing and marketing the surplus effectively. Unless urgent measures are taken to raise quality of potato and facilitate exports, the recurring cycle of bumper harvests turning into farmers' misery will persist.\nGiven the scale of production and the growing international demand, there is every reason to believe that Bangladesh can transform its potato sector into a success story. What is needed now is the will to move beyond rhetoric and take concrete and coordinated action.\nwasiahmed.bd@gmail.com\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Yet for many young people it is increasingly marked by overwhelming stress and anxiety. Recent studies suggest that nearly 90 per cent of university students suffer from mental pressure. The burden of heavy academic workloads, parental expectations, financial hardship and uncertainty about future careers adversely affect both their mental health and their day-to-day lives.\nThe problem goes far beyond examinations and grades. A significant number of students report feelings of isolation, loneliness and, at times, hopelessness. Sadly, because mental health remains a neglected subject in our society, many students remain silent about their struggles. This silence only deepens their suffering and often leads to more serious consequences.\nUniversities must take a leading role in addressing this growing crisis. They should establish well-functioning counselling services, arrange awareness workshops, and create safe and inclusive spaces where students can speak openly about their problems without fear of stigma. Alongside institutional support, teachers and parents also have an essential role. By listening with empathy and offering guidance, they can ease the unseen burdens that weigh so heavily on students' minds. Even a small gesture of kindness or encouragement can make a considerable difference.\nStudents are the backbone of our nation's future. If we truly want them to flourish with confidence and resilience, their mental well-being must be valued as much as their academic performance. After all, a strong mind is the foundation of a strong and prosperous future.\nArshie Akter Sunny\nMass Communication and Journalism\nJagannath University, Dhaka\narshieakter205@gmail.com\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Traditional methods, dependence on chemical fertilisers, and vulnerability to climate change continue to limit productivity. Yet the introduction of smart agriculture technologies -- such as drones, IoT-based soil sensors, precision farming, and AI-driven crop monitoring -- is beginning to reshape the sector.\nSmallholder farmers, who make up more than 80 per cent of the agricultural workforce (BBS, 2025), often lack access to modern tools. Smart solutions can help them optimise irrigation, monitor crop health in real time, reduce pesticide use, and increase yields. For example, AI-based weather models now assist rice and wheat farmers in preparing for floods or droughts, reducing losses and enhancing food security.\nGovernment initiatives like Digital Agriculture 2030, alongside collaborations with the FAO and the World Bank, are gradually expanding training, affordable tools, and financial support. In some areas using IoT irrigation systems, productivity has risen by 20-25 per cent -- a clear evidence of the benefits. Furthermore, smart agriculture creates new rural employment in drone operation, data analysis, and machinery maintenance, reducing pressure on cities and advancing sustainable development.\nPrivate enterprises and agri-tech start-ups are also stepping forward, linking farmers to buyers, finance, and advisory services. With lessons drawn from global successes such as India's e-Choupal and Israel's precision farming, Bangladesh has the potential to build a competitive and climate-resilient agricultural sector.\nHowever, challenges remain: high initial costs, limited digital literacy and uneven internet coverage hinder adoption. Government, private sector and NGOs must work together to provide subsidies, expand digital education, and improve rural connectivity.\nSmart agriculture offers Bangladesh a transformative course for boosting productivity, protecting the environment and empowering farmers. By embracing innovation now, the nation can secure both food security and rural prosperity for the future.\nTowfiq Sultan\nLecturer, Brave Jubilant Scholars of \nMonohardi Model College,\nMonohardi, Narsingdi\ntowfiqsultan.help@gmail.com\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
