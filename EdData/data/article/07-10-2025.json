Time and again, there have been serious threats to the goal of \u2018making in India\u2019, particularly in the pharmaceutical sector. The issue of quality of cough syrups has repeatedly been raised, and India with great ambitions in the global pharmaceutical sector has often been short of what is required to build a robust and trustworthy industry. Recently, the Union Health Ministry sought strict drug compliance from all Indian drug manufacturers, in line with the revised Schedule M norms for pharmaceutical products in India. This came after a report from the Tamil Nadu Drugs Control Department found above permissible limits of diethylene glycol (DEG) in samples of Coldrif, a cough syrup being manufactured by a private company. The tests were initiated after cough syrup was suspected to be behind the recent deaths of at least 16 children in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. Strangely, while the Health Ministry ruled out the presence of DEG, in initial tests conducted on samples from the two States, it was detected in one of the batches lifted by Tamil Nadu within the State. The State\u2019s Drugs Control Department also recorded several non-compliance factors in the Good Manufacturing Practices and Good Laboratory Practices of the Drugs Rules, at the manufacturing facility. Its report mentioned that the contaminated batch was manufactured using non-pharmacopoeial grade propylene glycol as an excipient. It mentioned that this might have contaminated the drug with DEG and ethylene glycol, known nephrotoxic substances. The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation has recommended cancellation of the firm\u2019s manufacturing licence. Meanwhile, a doctor who reportedly recommended the cough syrup to many of the children who died in Madhya Pradesh was arrested.While these measures are good to address the situation in the instant case, what the Indian state must do is have a zero threshold for poor quality drugs. Hawk-like monitoring is necessary, and action when violations are detected. It is criminal to act only when deaths have occurred; that is indefensible. A framework of proven Good Laboratory Practices already exists; what is needed is seriousness in handling every such reported violation, along with regular, surprise inspections of drug batches, with appropriate action taken for every violation. It is important to send the message down the assembly line that the government will not brook any shoddiness or violations that endanger the lives of people.

        "full_article": "The 2025 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has recognised discoveries that transformed the scientific understanding of autoimmune regulation. Today, researchers are exploring these conditions\u2019 genetic, molecular, and environmental determinants, paving the way for early diagnoses and targeted interventions. An important chunk of this advance is owed to the work of Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi, who established the role of regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and the transcription factor FOXP3. In the 1990s, immunologists had already defined the deletion of self-reactive T-cells during maturation, yet this process could not account for the persistence of autoreactive T-cells in healthy individuals. Sakaguchi figured that an additional mechanism must operate in the periphery. In 1995, his team identified a subset of CD4\u207a T-cells that, when they were removed from mice, led to multiple autoimmune disorders, while restoring the cells prevented disease. Next, Brunkow and Ramsdell, then at Celltech Chiroscience, found that male scurfy mice developed severe multi-organ autoimmunity and died within weeks of birth. They were able to narrow the mutation to the X chromosome, identifying an insertion in the DNA that truncated a previously unknown gene. They named it FOXP3, and found that losing it led to immune collapse. Soon, clinical collaborations reported mutations in FOXP3 in boys with a lethal autoimmune disorder. These findings together established that self-tolerance rested on a molecular switch governing the differentiation and maintenance of Tregs.Today, in autoimmune diseases, experimental treatments aim to expand or stabilise Tregs. Early clinical trials have shown that reinforcing this cell population can mitigate harmful immune activation without broad immunosuppression. In transplantation, engineered Tregs are being infused to improve graft acceptance. In cancer, researchers are exploring selective depletion or reprogramming of tumour-associated Tregs to enhance immunity without triggering autoimmunity. Beyond therapy, the conceptual shift brought on by the laureates\u2019 work has redefined the immune system: from an on/off apparatus to a dynamic ecosystem of activation and restraint. That Brunkow and Ramsdell conducted their work within industry also underscores how private sector research can yield significant discoveries. But even now, some immunologists caution against underestimating the field\u2019s incremental nature. In a testament to the broader landscape including overlapping layers of control rather than a single molecular pathway, researchers face several obstacles to translating what they know to safe, scalable therapies. Cell-based therapies\u2019 high cost has also accentuated inequities in access, creating ethical and policy challenges.\r Published - October 07, 2025 12:10 am IST\n                          Read  Comments \n                Copy link  \n                        \n            \n                    Email     \n                                \n                \n                Facebook   \n                        \n            \n                Twitter    \n                        \n            \n                Telegram     \n                        \n            \n                LinkedIn     \n                        \n            \n                WhatsApp\n                \n                        \n            \n                Reddit      \n                        \n            READ LATER\n                SEE ALL         \n                \n                    Remove     \n                PRINT\n            Related Topics\n        \n                        award and prize\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        medicine\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        science (general)\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        diabetes\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        health treatment\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        medical research\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        disease",

        "full_article": "Another govt hospital, another fire, more hapless patients killed\u2026And maybe another insincere audit?\nWhen a fire breaks out at a hospital, something that seems to happen with dreadful regularity in India, some patients are particularly vulnerable. For example, when a blaze swept through the NICU ward in Jhansi\u2019s Maharani Laxmi Bai Medical College in Nov 2024, it killed 11 newborns. Likewise, when the ICU in Jaipur\u2019s Sawai Man Singh Hospital caught fire Sunday night, it was critical patients, at least six of them, who lost their lives. Rescue protocols obviously give high priority to patients who have suboptimal mobility, life-support requirements, and other special vulnerabilities. But there is little hope of these protocols being observed when basic fire safety standards aren\u2019t.\nPatients\u2019 attendants have given horrifying accounts of what happened in Jaipur this weekend. Per these, the staff both ignored early warnings of the fire and abandoned patients during the fire. Staff on the other hand have cited their own injuries to say they tried their best. One congruency between all the accounts is that it was a chaotic situation. Was this chaos excusable? Not if the fire safety equipment, compliance and training were lacking. Political voices promise or demand \u2018swift probe\u2019 with the same alacrity with which they \u2018express grief\u2019. But as we near the death anniversary of the Jhansi newborns, all we seem to have to blame for their deaths is a short circuit and missing sprinklers. The tragic odds are that Rajasthan will no more see a meta audit than Uttar Pradesh did.\nStudies show that the overwhelming majority (78% in one accounting) of significant hospital fires in India are caused by short circuits and take place at night. These further suggest that simple adaptations can help mitigate the risks and save lives. But this first needs curing govt amnesia between one tragedy and the next. Although rising healthcare demand needs increased healthcare capacity, substandard facilities bring as much harm as help. Both the Jhansi and Jaipur hospitals mentioned here are major govt establishments. Govt should enforce exemplary accountability, including criminal culpability. That is what the afflicted families need rather than rote condolences.\n\n",

        "full_article": "It\u2019s been India\u2019s most backward state for far too long. But can voters force politicians to change?\u00a0\nOn Nov 6 and 11, Bihar will decide who governs it for the next five years. Election days are important in every state, but for Bihar \u2013 named the poorest region in south Asia not too long ago \u2013 they are critical. The will of its 7.4cr electors will determine, among other things, whether Bihar finally moves up from the bottom of the per-capita income rankings, where it has languished for decades.\nTo the credit of Bihar\u2019s electorate, it is not easily swayed by emotive issues, unlike voters in many prosperous states. In the 2020 polls, held in the shadow of Covid lockdowns, the key issues were unemployment and migration, flood havoc, and corruption. The state\u2019s electors are quite hard-nosed in that sense, and vocal, but oddly lackadaisical when it comes to voting. After the modest highs of the 1990s, turnout fell sharply in 2005, and remained around the 57% mark the last two times.\nOne hopes it isn\u2019t a sign of disenchantment. Bihar has been a laggard on social and economic indicators for so long that some voters may have given up hope of change. And there\u2019s so much that needs to change for the better in the state. Be it child malnutrition, school enrolment, literacy rate, infant mortality, access to water, sanitation and electricity \u2013 Bihar trails the rest of the country. The income gap is shocking. The average Bihar resident earns less than a third as much as the average Indian \u2013 \u20b932,227 vs \u20b91,14,710 in 2023-24 (in terms of 2014 rupees). But the national average hides high incomes in large states like Karnataka (\u20b91.9L) and Tamil Nadu (\u20b91.8L).\nThis is as much a consequence of their rise as of Bihar\u2019s decline. In 1960s, Bihar had the fifth largest economy among Indian states \u2013 bigger than those of Gujarat and Karnataka. Its per capita income was even then below the national average, but at 70%, unlike 28% now. And that\u2019s the slide Bihar\u2019s voters would want to reverse with their choice next month. There\u2019s no point in blaming historical wrongs \u2013 British permanent settlement 230 years ago, and the freight equalisation policy that erased Bihar\u2019s natural advantage for industrialisation after Independence. Today, any state with a determined govt can script a turnaround in 10-15 years, as Odisha has shown. Bihar\u2019s own indicators have crept upwards, but its development needs to shift gears. The coming election should be about that.\n\n",

With a thrill, I realise that I\u2019ve been given a wildcard entry into a jam session that straddles many traffic signals and spills into every available side lane. An emergency vehicle ululates in the background, providing the master\u2019s flourish to the open-source street symphony. Nodding in acknowledgement, I thump the horn enthusiastically.\u00a0\nAs in every concert, music lovers are expected to pay close attention if they don\u2019t want to miss the nuances. String and woodwind instruments generated by what seems to be all the automobiles in the universe form the leitmotif. Adding texture to the symphony are the baritones of this orchestral chorus \u2013 buses packed no doubt with rapt connoisseurs. At the beating heart of the ensemble lie percussion instruments that never miss a beat. While all the talented performers play their part well, there\u2019s no doubt that the virtuoso of the troupe is the popular auto-rickshaw which, through amazing improvisation, can seem to be here, there and everywhere.\u00a0\nSuch musical compositions, however, are not for everyone. The untutored are likely to miss the sweeping majesty of it all. They ask idle questions about meaning and motive. Why oh why? Why do people in India blow their horn so loudly, frequently and rudely? Is the horn a navigation tool in mufti? This kind of negativist attitude comes in the way of aficionados savouring the interplay of emotions. They will not burst into applause when the imperious blast of authority in an SUV is squelched by the squawk of the delivery boys on flimsy two-wheelers. Neither will they be moved by the piteous protest of the overtaken underdog.\u00a0\nBut the glory days of this elevated art form could soon come to an end. Like smoking, honking too has been deemed injurious to health. Govt plans to enforce an upper limit of around 50 decibels \u2013 the existing clamour is twice as much. Road transport ministry has further suggested that the conventional horns be changed to emit sounds of traditional Indian instruments like the flute, tabla, violin and harmonium \u2013 atmanirbharta made audible. Well, as long as the Indian driver and his horn are not parted. I eagerly await the new playlist.\n\n",

        "full_article": "By Jug Suraiya\nIf God did not exist we would have had to invent him, is a saying attributed to Voltaire. And now humankind has done exactly that. We have invented if not God with a capital G, at least god with a small g in the form of apps that connect the user with AI-enabled chatbots who, programmed with scriptural texts from various faith systems, provide spiritual solace and guidance to followers who reportedly number tens of millions the world over.\nThe \u2018faith tech\u2019 industry is booming like a thunderstorm and raining not pennies but mega dollars from a digital heaven. A single app, Bible Chat, reportedly has over 30mn followers. Another called Hallow, which is predominantly Catholic, has overtaken Netflix, Instagram and TikTok in popularity. In China app-licants are going to DeepSeek to find out what the future holds for them, while Pray.com with a subscription fee of $75 per year has 25mn customers.\n\nReligious leaders are divided on the issue of chatbots providing healing balm for the soul. A rabbi has been quoted as saying, \u201cThere\u2019s a whole generation which has never been to a church or a synagogue. Spiritual apps are the way to faith.\u201d\nOthers disagree. Salvationrequires struggle, not a push-button solution. \u201cThere is something good about really, really wrestling through a problem,\u201d says a Catholic priest who expresses fears about the danger of pouring out one\u2019s heart to a chatbot.\nSpiritual chatbots are often put to frivolous use by net surfers. For instance, a hugely popular faith tech app called AI Jesus has fielded questions like, \u201cHey, Jesus, which is your favourite football team?\u201d Classical Greek drama often used a theatrical device called the Deus ex machina, literally \u2018God from the machine\u2019, whereby a seemingly irresolvable situation is brought to a conclusion by divine intercession.\nThe term derives from a mechanical crane or trapdoor which enabled the deity to descend or ascend to the stage and bring the drama to an end.\nExtensively employed by Aristophanes among other Greek playwrights, the literary device was seen by purists to be a gimmick by which the author evaded the rigour of true artistic creation.\nSimilarly, faith tech or app apotheosis, could be decried as mere gimmickry for the gullible. But if one regards prayer as a form of self-conversation or self-communion in which an individual seeks union with a universality by using a token object or saying which represents it, a chatbot might be as valid an aid to such outreaching as an image of a deity, or a religious symbol such as a crucifix, or a swastika, or an acoustic incantation like a mantra.\nIn his Sermon on the Mount, Christ enjoined us to realise that the kingdom of heaven lies within ourselves. The divinity we seek is not out there, but is part of us, as we are part of it.\nThe Sanskrit phrase from Advaita, Tat Twam Asi, Thou Art That, is an injunction that the individual and the universe are contiguous in a seamless unity.\nFor our cyber age, can this ageless mantra be reiterated as Thou Art AI? To which a digital sage might reply: Why not?\n\n",

All water channels such as rivers, canals and sewerage system will be integrated in order to ensure water security, flood control and sanitation. Given the total cost of the programme at $8.5 billion and implementable between 2026 and 2040, many would consider it a pipe dream but for the World Bank's backing it with both finance and technical support. Yes, the WB has found merit in supporting the programme and committed to provide $600 million for the first phase called Metro Dhaka Water Security and Resilience (DWATER) programme requiring $1.0 billion. The WB's contribution will cover 60 per cent of the projected total cost for the first phase to be executed by 2031. \nThe World Bank's participation with the issuance of a concept Programme Information Document (PID) that serves as a draft Environmental and Social Systems Assessment (ESSA) is highly laudable and encouraging. When the WB finds merit in a programme, others will consider investment in the scheme worth doing. The Economic Relations Division (ERD) is yet to approach donors or financiers for the remaining 40 per cent cost of the first phase. Since the DWATER project envisions a scenario where the inhabitants of the capital and the neighbouring urban centres will have universal access to safe water supply and sanitation (WSS), the attainment of the objectives on completion of the first phase will mark a paradigm shift in the liveability index. Its other components like solid waste management, industrial effluent control and canal rehabilitation are no less important. It gives the impression that the DWATER programme is comprehensive enough to focus on the management of water resources in and around the capital city. \nHowever, the $1.0 billion fund earmarked for the first phase looks inadequate for the projected accomplishments. Restoring canals that once served as the arteries of Dhaka City is too ambitious to be executed. Also, how a political government to take over from the current interim one views the projects matters. Many of the canals have no existence. Even the restored canals have once again been encroached upon or rendered useless on account of dumping of garbage and sludge. Then comes the restoring the rivers' health. The WB's concept paper reports that 1,500 million litres of untreated sewage, 2,400 million litres of effluent and 10,000 tonnes of solid waste are released into the rivers Buriganga, Sitalakhya and Turag every day. Management of the pollution of this order is highly challenging.\nUnder the wider perspective of the Blue Network, however, the restoration of canals, rivers and other water bodies can be accomplished better. Irrespective of how the future political governments will react to the programme, one thing is quite clear that without execution of such a programme, Dhaka City will be unliveable. The WB's involvement with the projects is an indication of the compulsion governments coming next should feel to save the city from falling apart. The cost of rehabilitating its water infrastructure will be less than opting for a new capital elsewhere.\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

For more than a decade they have produced sleek, colourful sequences for global entertainment giants -- from television commercials to mobile games -- often without anyone knowing the work was done in Dhaka rather than Delhi or Manila. The talent is there; the infrastructure is not. Were the state to take the industry seriously, insiders reckon, exports could reach $3 billion within a few years.\nThat is no small sum for a country still dependent on shirts and shrimp. Globally the animation business is booming, driven by the explosion of streaming services, games and digital advertising. Analysts expect the market to reach $550 billion by 2030. Neighbouring India and China already dominate the outsourcing end of this value chain. Bangladesh, with its low costs, English-speaking youth and digital literacy, could claim a slice. But instead of becoming an exporter of ideas, it remains an exporter of labour.\nRoughly 20,000 people now work in animation studios across Bangladesh. They are young -- nearly 28 per cent of the country's population is under 30 -- and technically adept. In a nation struggling with graduate unemployment of over 40 per cent, the creative industries ought to look like a gift. Animation is labour-intensive, scalable and largely immune to logistics bottlenecks. Yet despite producing world-class material, most Bangladeshi studios operate as anonymous subcontractors, their names erased from the credits.\nAccording to industry insiders, it's a ten-billion-dollar opportunity hiding in plain sight.\nMany believe Bangladesh's bureaucrats still treat animation as a curiosity rather than a commercial prospect.\nThe Ministry of ICT, notionally responsible for nurturing digital industries, admits there are \"no current plans\" to invest in sectoral infrastructure. Projects may be \"considered after the next government is in place,\" an official says. That is bureaucratese for \"not any time soon.\"\nProducing professional-grade animation requires hardware muscle. Rendering -- the process of converting complex 3D data into finished visuals -- demands banks of high-end computers known as rendering farms. These cost millions to build but are easily shared. Bangladesh has none. Studios rely on rented overseas servers, pushing up costs and turnaround times.\nThen there is regulation. The country's financial rules, designed for a world of tangible goods, make hiring or paying foreign specialists a headache. Because the central bank keeps tight control over foreign-currency transfers, paying international consultants can take months, if it is permitted at all. \"In most countries entrepreneurs can pay foreign staff directly through convertible capital accounts,' notes an entrepreneur adding 'In Bangladesh that's nearly impossible.'\nThis protectionism may safeguard foreign-exchange reserves but it also blocks skill transfer. Animation is global by nature: collaboration with foreign designers and storytellers is essential. Without a mechanism to move money smoothly across borders, Bangladesh cannot build the partnerships that give creative industries scale.\nThe industry's ailments are not technical but institutional. Infrastructure, finance and training are the holy trinity of digital growth; all three are missing. India's government, for instance, created regional animation clusters, tax breaks and dedicated export zones, helping the sector surpass $2.5 billion in annual revenue. China poured billions into animation schools and content studios to promote \"cultural self-confidence.\" Bangladesh, by contrast, spends more on regulating Facebook than on fostering its own digital content.\nA few interventions could change that. Tax rebates for creative exports, public-private partnerships for shared rendering hubs, simplified foreign-payment rules and targeted vocational training would be a start. The country's Export Promotion Bureau could treat animated content like ready-made garments: a product with comparative advantage and global demand.\nSo far, however, policymaking remains stuck in analogue mode. The state continues to equate technology with hardware -- assembling mobile phones or laptops -- rather than intellectual property. Creative industries require a different mindset: one that values code, story and design as tradable assets.\nThe case for animation is not purely economic. Creative exports confer soft power. South Korea built a global image through K-pop and dramas; Japan did it with anime. Bangladesh, too, once captured imaginations with \"Meena,\" a UNICEF-backed animated series launched in 1993 that taught children across South Asia about equality and education. It became a cultural touchstone -- and a reminder that animation can transmit social ideas more effectively than lectures or laws.\nSince Meena, progress has been glacial. The few public initiatives that exist focus on one-off projects rather than ecosystem building. There is no national animation policy, no state-backed institute, no funding scheme for start-ups in the field. Universities teach design but rarely link graduates to commercial pipelines. Studios remain isolated, struggling to find financing or global exposure.\n\"Without an ecosystem, talent leaks away,\" laments a chief executive of an animation house.\nOur best animators end up working for overseas firms. Bangladesh gets the wages, not the intellectual property, he lamented.\nIndeed, the biggest threat is not failure but invisibility. Thousands of Bangladeshi animators already freelance for studios in North America or East Asia. They are paid per project, with no credit and no residuals. Their skills enrich global brands while the domestic industry stagnates. It is the digital equivalent of the garment sector's low-wage model -- efficient but unrewarding.\nEscaping this trap means building original intellectual property: home-grown characters, stories and visual worlds that can travel. The folklore of Bengal -- from the Nakshi Kantha to Thakurmar Jhuli -- is rich source material. But original content requires risk capital and marketing, not just technical expertise. Here again, policy inertia bites. Bangladesh's venture-capital scene remains small, and state banks view intangible assets with suspicion.\nIf properly financed, local studios could exploit a global appetite for diverse voices. Platforms such as Netflix and Disney+ now actively seek non-Western content. The Bangladeshi diaspora alone constitutes a ready audience. Yet without a pipeline for financing, intellectual-property protection and international distribution, those opportunities slip away.\nBeyond cultural pride lies a pragmatic argument. Each animation studio employs programmers, writers, sound designers, marketers and project managers -- exactly the sort of high-skill, urban jobs Bangladesh needs. Unlike manufacturing, creative work has low environmental impact and high export potential. It can be done from anywhere with broadband.\nYouth unemployment, officially around 10 per cent but far higher among graduates, makes the need urgent. The International Labour Organisation estimates that two-thirds of new graduates struggle to find suitable work. A thriving animation industry could absorb part of this surplus while diversifying exports. It would also align neatly with the government's \"Smart Bangladesh\" vision of a knowledge economy.\nThe alternative is grim: a generation of tech-savvy youth underemployed in call centres or migrating abroad. The country risks squandering not just a market opportunity but a social one.\nTo move from promise to policy, Bangladesh needs three shifts.\nFirst, build infrastructure. Shared rendering farms and cloud facilities could be developed through public-private partnerships, reducing costs for small studios. The state already builds technology parks; adding a creative-content wing would be trivial.\nSecond, liberalise payments. A modest reform of foreign-currency rules -- allowing verified digital exporters to pay for overseas services through licensed platforms -- would unlock international collaboration. The central bank could monitor flows digitally, minimising abuse.\nThird, invest in people. Subsidised training programmes, internships and university linkages could produce a new generation of animators, scriptwriters and producers. A national institute for animation and digital arts would signal seriousness.\nSuch measures would not strain the budget. The entire sector today is smaller than a mid-sized garment factory. But its multiplier effects could be huge: every dollar spent on creative infrastructure generates far more value than on bricks and mortar.\nBangladesh's policymakers are fond of talking about \"graduating\" from least-developed-country status. That transition will not be achieved by sewing more T-shirts. It will come from exporting imagination. The digital economy is borderless; creative capital, once developed, compounds quickly.\nYet the country's instincts remain defensive. Where India and Vietnam court global studios, Bangladesh worries about capital flight. Where others subsidise innovation, it fears \"misuse of funds.\" Such caution may keep accountants happy, but it leaves the country creatively paralysed.\nTo its credit, the interim government led by Dr. Muhammad Yunus has spoken often about diversification and youth employment. If those words are to mean anything, creative industries should be part of the reform portfolio. A modest Creative-Industry Fund, tax relief for export-oriented studios and inclusion of digital content in export-credit schemes would be a good start.\nThe private sector must also act. Local investors, quick to back fintech or logistics start-ups, have so far ignored animation. Yet the potential returns -- both cultural and commercial -- are immense. Regional streaming services, gaming platforms and advertising agencies are all hungry for cost-efficient creative production.\nFor Bangladesh, animation is more than an industry; it is a test of whether the country can evolve from a producer of cheap goods to a creator of intellectual value. The ingredients -- talent, connectivity, youth -- are already present. What is missing is vision.\nLeft alone, the sector will continue to churn out invisible exports: brilliant work signed under someone else's logo. With policy support, it could generate billions, create high-value jobs and project a modern image of a country too often pigeonholed as poor but industrious.\nBangladesh once taught South Asia lessons about microfinance and social enterprise. It could, with equal imagination, become a model for creative entrepreneurship. The world is ready to watch. The question is whether Dhaka is ready to draw.\nmirmostafiz@yahoo.com\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

There are reports of anthrax infection in Pirgachha upazila of the northern district of Rangpur. Though ruminating, hooved and grazing animals like cow, goat, lamb, etc., are usually infected by anthrax, humans can also contract the disease from physical contact with infected parts of the animals. A rod-shaped bacteria called bacillus anthracis causes the disease. The term bacillus is derived from the Latin word baculum meaning 'little staff or rod' and the word anthracis, has its root in the Greek word 'anthrakis' meaning coal. So, the name of the germ at once describes its physical characteristics and the black lesion that its infection creates on an infected person's body. The bacteria usually pass through any cut or injury on a person's body that may come in contact with the infected part of the animal or its flesh. Some 50 people who reportedly contracted anthrax in Pirgachha upazila handled the infected animals' meat. \nSimilar reports of anthrax infection among people are coming from Mithapukur and Kaunia upazilas of the same district. The bad news is-- two people reportedly died in the Pirgachha upazila who had symptoms of anthrax infection. According to some reports, during last July and September, over 300 cattle died of anthrax. This is not the first time that anthrax outbreak happened in the country. Even so, the reports that the disease is spreading among both humans and farm animals in the northern district of Rangpur is a matter to be taken seriously. Death of some 300 farm animals is a shocking development for the livestock resource of the country. The death of two people who bore symptoms of anthrax attack needs further investigation to confirm if they actually succumbed to anthrax. The health authority, particularly the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), should carry out investigation to find out under what circumstances those two people actually died. From another report, it could be further learnt that eight villagers in Pirgachha upazila were carrying anthrax germ, IEDCR experts confirmed. Anthrax germ has also been reportedly found in the beef some people of the locality kept in their fridges.\nIn this connection, measures are learnt to have been taken by the local administration to vaccinate more than 150,000 cattle, while butchers of the local bazaars and villagers raising cattle have been told to keep the infected animals under observation. These are certainly positive steps taken by the local authorities to keep the spread of anthrax in the area under control. At the same time, it will also be necessary to prohibit slaughtering of diseased animals and sale of their meat in the market. Anthrax is a killer disease in animals. Going by previous records, in the middle of 2010, Belkuchi and Kamarkhond upazilas of Sirajganj district saw an outbreak of the disease. By the second week of September of that year, the disease spread to several other districts of the country. It infected a large number of animals and people. In consequence, panic spread among the populace in those districts leading to a sharp decline in the consumption of animal meat, especially of beef and mutton. The panic not only adversely impacted export of halal meat, it also affected hide and skin trade, even export of footwear and bone meal. Livestock farming was hard hit. \nSo, population of the districts affected by anthrax needs to be duly educated about the nature of the disease so they might not be unreasonably panicked.\nsfalim.ds@gmail.com\nShare if you like \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
