The Census in 2021 did not take place as planned, thus impacting different aspects of governance, especially social security schemes for vulnerable populations that rely heavily on updated demographic data for effective and efficient delivery. For the first time, the Census will be digitally administered, enabling faster data gathering and easier accessibility for analysis, thereby allowing population-level data to be more dynamic. However, this technological adoption also heightens concerns regarding data theft and privacy. While the nature of the Census will evolve, transparency at all levels will be crucial to building public trust in the exercise. Preparations for this massive operation, which will reach every household, are underway, with more logistical details anticipated in the weeks ahead.India stands at a demographic crossroads, facing the challenges of growing populations of the young and the old alongside significant regional variations in key indicators. Fresh data from the Census can help address many issues. For the first time since 1931, caste categories will be enumerated. While more reliable data on the socio-economic standing of caste groups can inform development planning, the potential for further social segmentation makes caste enumeration a double-edged sword. A critical aspect of the upcoming Census is its link to the next delimitation of Lok Sabha and Assembly constituencies, which will redraw India\u2019s electoral map. The Constitution mandates that the next inter-State delimitation be based on population figures from the first Census after 2026. The current distribution of Lok Sabha seats is based on the 1971 population spread. With the reference date for the Census set as March 1, 2027, for most of the country, this can pave the way for the next delimitation exercise. States that have experienced lower population growth in recent decades, particularly in the peninsular region, have expressed concern that their parliamentary representation will diminish if population becomes the sole criterion for redistribution. The Centre has yet to clarify its stance on this matter. With the Census now in motion, it is imperative for the Centre to engage with all stakeholders and build consensus on the sensitive issue of delimitation. Otherwise, the delay in the announcement of the Census will be taken to mean as an attempt to ensure that the ruling BJP benefits from the increased representation for the Hindi-speaking States.

        "full_article": "In less than 24 hours, ecstasy turned into despair. Royal Challengers Bengaluru\u2019s (RCB) maiden Indian Premier League (IPL) title, secured on Tuesday night (June 3, 2025) in Ahmedabad, triggered unabated joy and raucous celebrations in Bengaluru and the rest of Karnataka. However, by Wednesday evening (June 4, 2025), a thick shroud of grief hung over the southern metropolis as a ghastly stampede in and around RCB\u2019s home ground, the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, left 11 dead and more than 50 injured. The hallowed venue was hosting a felicitation event in honour of the victorious team while fans outside, desperate to get in, ended up as a heaving chaotic mass with many gasping for breath. Asphyxia was the primary cause of death besides injuries suffered in the stifling rush. Sport is often a tight pact between the performing athlete and the adoring fan; it triggers emotions, and in the case of the IPL, forges a connection between the franchise and a vast audience. RCB has always had a loyal fan base, and the IPL triumph was bound to attract followers running into lakhs, towards the Central Business District of M.G. Road, Brigade Road, Cubbon Road, Queens Road and KSCA Clubhouse Link Road. Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah admitted that the crowd was beyond expectations.However, to use a massive gathering as an explanation for an avoidable accident, is unacceptable. The multitude of fans near the Vidhana Soudha, the State legislature, from Wednesday morning (June 4, 2025) should have compelled the authorities to tighten crowd control protocols. RCB had proclaimed that there would be an open-bus parade, but the police clarified that it would not happen. With no access to the Vidhana Soudha where the Chief Minister felicitated the players, the frenzied gathering rushed towards the stadium for a glimpse of stars such as Virat Kohli. The rumours about the gates being open to the public, and the contradictory messages about entry by invitation only, exacerbated the crisis. As the venue was packed, gates were closed but fans tried to force their way in. Be it the Karnataka State Cricket Association\u2019s (KSCA) security or police personnel, staffing was inadequate and a fatal climax was inevitable. The State Government, the RCB management, the KSCA and the BCCI have expressed their condolences while some have indulged in finger-pointing. The Chief Minister has announced that the Bengaluru Police Commissioner and all officials responsible for the jurisdiction where the stadium is have been suspended, pending an inquiry. There will also be a judicial inquiry. However, the grim truth is that the fan, who drives the commerce of every sport, is the last priority for administrators. Clear communication, effective policing and proper advance notice for an event of this scale are all essential or else, such tragedies might recur periodically.

        "full_article": "Govt did well to address some of Ladakh\u2019s concerns. Remaining issues must be resolved sensitively\nGOI did the right thing by introducing a new reservation and domicile policy for Ladakh. Guaranteeing 85% reservations for locals in govt jobs \u2013 excluding EWS category \u2013 will address local anxiety about high unemployment. It\u2019s important to recall that Ladakhis have been peacefully pressing for their demands, in the best traditions of democracy. This was best exemplified by activist Sonam Wangchuk\u2019s walk from Ladakh to Delhi and subsequent 16-day hunger strike last year. To its credit, govt did consult Ladakh\u2019s civil society organisations before working out the new policies. However, key demands remain unfulfilled.\nLadakh\u2019s demands stem from the fact that following nullification of Article 370 in 2019 that abrogated special status for the erstwhile state of Jammu & Kashmir \u2013 of which Ladakh was a part \u2013 the region was hived off and converted to a UT without a legislature. While initially welcomed \u2013 because Ladhakis often felt govts in Srinagar were biased against the region \u2013 the new setup was soon seen as inadequate in addressing key issues like unemployment, preservation of local culture, and protection of a fragile ecosystem.\nHence the demand for inclusion of Ladakh in the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution. It can\u2019t be stressed enough that ecological conservation is central to Ladakh\u2019s aspirations. The region is experiencing serious glacier retreat, with some glaciers like Parachik retreating by 12-20 metres per annum. Therefore, development here can\u2019t happen the same way as in other regions. We have already seen the adverse impact of non-ecologically compliant infra projects in mountainous states. Also, Ladakh\u2019s status as a border region with China and Pakistan brings additional security challenges. Ecology and security are joined at the hip here. Therefore, defence infra projects and people\u2019s aspirations must be in harmony. People of Ladakh are our shield. Listen to them.\n\n",

        "full_article": "Why two HCs\u2019 observations on freedom of expression make for troubling reading\nFreedom of expression is a precondition for democracy, and progress. Ideas are easily expressed through words, but sometimes more powerfully through art, as England-based street artist Banksy demonstrates frequently. India\u2019s Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and expression, with reasonable restrictions. The key word is \u2018reasonable\u2019. However, two recent high court observations appear to strain the word.\nAt first glance, Calcutta HC\u2019s remarks for social media content creator Sharmistha Panoli, and Karnataka HC\u2019s rebuke to actor Kamal Hassan, seem indisputable. Panoli is in the dock for her alleged comments against a community, after Op Sindoor. Calcutta HC told her, \u201cLook, we have freedom of speech, but that doesn\u2019t mean you will go on to hurt others.\u201d To Hassan, who has ruffled feathers by suggesting Kannada is an offshoot of Tamil, Karnataka HC said, \u201cYou may be Kamal Hassan or anybody, you cannot hurt the sentiments of the masses.\u201d\nEffectively, both courts have said: take care your words don\u2019t hurt others. If this sets a precedent, all conversation, discussion, debate in this country will need to be convivial. Speakers, writers, artists will need to err on the side of caution not to annoy their audience. Even then, the sword of causing hurt will hang over their heads. The safest thing would be to shut up. Freedom of speech and expression is a hard-earned modern right. Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno was burnt alive for propagating the idea of an infinite universe, which offended the Church. Galileo lived his last years under house arrest for holding the view that Earth revolves around the Sun. One person\u2019s conviction is another\u2019s heresy, that\u2019s why making others\u2019 \u201csentiments\u201d, opinions and feelings the test of good/bad speech is the surest way to destroy free speech.\nSupreme Court recently took this view while deciding the Imran Pratapgarhi case. It said the effect of words \u201ccannot be judged on the basis of the standards of people who always have a sense of insecurity or of those who always perceive criticism as a threat to their power or position\u201d and \u201ceven if a large number of persons dislike the views expressed by another, the right of the person to express the views must be respected and protected.\u201d Unpalatable or hostile words certainly vitiate the atmosphere, but the solution is not to pack commentators inside jails. SC has a better prescription: counter views with views.\u00a0\n\n",

The showcase windows of cafes, bars, restaurants, display in seductive array, a mountainous munificence of cakes, pastries, tarts, confections oozing jam, chocolate, cream, and other sugary allurements.\nAnd, of course, there are the ubiquitous gelaterias, specialising in the Italian version of ice cream, with their towering, multicoloured, multi-flavoured, Alpine peaks of irresistible temptation.As a popular saying goes, a day without gelato is a day wasted.\nTypically, Italians begin the day with a breakfast of coffee, accompanied by a sweet croissant. Other meals, particularly la cena, or dinner, are incomplete without Dolci, the dessert course.\nDespite its sweet tooth, Italy doesn\u2019t seem to have an obesity problem, unlike US or UK. This might be because the civic authorities have taken pains to ensure an almost total lack of public transport, even in Rome, the capital. This necessitates people having to walk or cycle everywhere to burn off excess calories.\nTrading on the Italian passion for the sugary, India should promote the export of its own wide range of confectionery \u2013 jalebis, barfis, laddoos, gulab jamuns, et al \u2013 to a welcoming Bella Italia.\nFor both parties, it would be a sweet deal, which more than mithais the aye.\n\n",
